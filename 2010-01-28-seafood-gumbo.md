This was something I just threw together with what I had in the house, so the ingredient list is rather long. I&#8217;m writing it up because my father really liked it. I might have a stab at a simplified version in the future.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 6 cups of chicken broth
  * 1/2 bottle of white wine
  * 3 oz dried shiitake mushrooms
  * 3 oz dried portabello mushrooms
  * 1 dried <span style="font-style: italic;">pasilla</span> chipotle pepper
  * 3 medium onions, sliced
  * Olive oil for sautee
  * 28-oz can whole tomatoes
  * 1 lemon, juice and zest
  * 2 tbsp reduced sodium tamari
  * 2 tbsp cornstarch
  * 1/2 lb frozen peas
  * 1 lb frozen cut okra
  * 1 lb shellfish (I used Trader Joe&#8217;s frozen &#8220;seafood medley&#8221;)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INSTRUCTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. In a small bowl, immerse the mushrooms and chipotle in enough boiling water to cover; let stand covered for ten minutes. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Do not drain!</span>
  2. Saut√© the onions over medium-high heat until golden.
  3. Meanwhile, combine broth, tomatoes, lemon juice and zest, okra, peas, tomatoes, and tamari in a soup pot.
  4. Transfer the mushrooms and chipotle to the soup mixture. Strain the soaking liquid and add it to the soup.
  5. Transfer the onions to the soup. Deglaze the pan with the wine, then transfer this liquid to the soup.
  6. Bring soup to a boil. Reduce to simmer, and allow to cook, covered, for 1 hour.
  7. Remove a few tablespoons of broth in a cup. Add the cornstarch and stir vigorously until dissolved. Stir back into the soup.
  8. Add the seafood to the soup. Even if frozen, it will cook very quickly. Do not boil.

Adjust salt to taste. Keeps for several days.
