<span>This is my take on the succulent Portuguese bean stew of the same name. Being a New Englander, I could not resist making it slightly sweet, but the spirit of the authentic thing shines through. I would have loved to use some tawny port instead of sherry, but that was all I had.</p> 

<p>
  Initially, I made the stew in a slow cooker; but this dried out the linguica. I have not yet tried it out on range-top, but I have a very good idea of how it should come out. All in all, I am quite pleased with this excellent winter stew.<br /></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />INGREDIENTS</span> 
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      1 lb. dry black beans, soaked overnight
    </li>
    <li>
      2 lbs oxtail, trimmed
    </li>
    <li>
      1 lb. linguica, cut on a bias into 1/3&#8243; rounds
    </li>
    <li>
      1 large onion, <a href="http://tofuvavohu.blogspot.com/2008/10/how-to-dice-onion.html">diced</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      3 large cloves garlic, <a href="http://tofuvavohu.blogspot.com/2008/06/how-to-crush-garlic.html">crushed</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      1/2 cup pitted prunes
    </li>
    <li>
      1/4 cup tawny port or sherry
    </li>
    <li>
      7 cups water
    </li>
    <li>
      Olive oil for sauté
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS</span> 
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a heavy pot, brown the oxtail over medium-high heat until seared on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Remove and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium-low; add olive oil. <a href="http://tofuvavohu.blogspot.com/2008/01/caramelized-onion-trick.html">Sauté onions and garlic until caramelized</a>, about 10 minutes, turning frequently.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the port and scrape the bottom of the pan with a spatula. (If using a nonstick pot, be sure to use a plastic spatula.) This should free up all browned bits from the oxtail and the onions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add all remaining ingredients to the pot, and simmer on medium-low for 1 1/2 hours or until beans are tender.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
      Serve with white rice.
