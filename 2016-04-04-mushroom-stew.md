_Based on this recipe from NY Times:_ [_http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015198-fresh-and-wild-mushroom-stew_](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015198-fresh-and-wild-mushroom-stew)

_ _

3 lbs mushrooms, any kind, cleaned and sliced

20g dried porcini

Pinch of saffron

1 tbsp tomato paste

3 plum tomatoes, chopped

3 cups boiling water

4 tbsp olive oil, divided use

½ tsp asafetida

1 large onion, diced

¾ tsp fresh rosemary, finely chopped

¾ tsp fresh sage, finely chopped

2 tbsp flour

Salt and pepper

&nbsp;

  1. Pour the boiling water over the porcini and saffron and allow to sit for at least 20 minutes. After it has soaked for that long, remove the porcinis, mince them and set aside.

&nbsp;

<ol start="2">
  <li>
    Meanwhile, heat 2 tbsp of olive oil on high in a wide saucepan. Add the asafetida and allow it to dissolve, then add the onions. Add some salt and pepper. Sautee until golden, about 10 minutes. Remove onions and set aside.
  </li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    Heat another 2 tbsp of olive oil on high in the saucepan. Add the mushrooms. If they put off a lot of water, allow them to cook until it’s all cooked away and they have sautéed to a meaty consistency.
  </li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    Reduce heat to medium. Add the chopped tomatoes, tomato paste, herbs, and minced porcini. Allow to cook for another 3-5 minutes.
  </li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

<ol start="5">
  <li>
    Add flour and combine well. Allow to cook for one minute. Add the onions and cook one minute more. Add broth. Simmer for 10 minutes.
  </li>
</ol>

&nbsp;

Serve with brunost yogurt and pasta. So good together.
