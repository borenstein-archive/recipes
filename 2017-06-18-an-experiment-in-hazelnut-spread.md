Tried adapting [this recipe](https://www.splendidtable.org/recipes/homemade-nutella) as follows. The result was still far too sweet for me. Next time, try using 6 oz unsweetened chocolate and 6 oz bittersweet. Also, I&#8217;m not sure you need so much vegetable oil if you are using soy lecithin and whole milk powder; try using 1 tbsp.

  * 10 oz Ghirardeli bittersweet chocolate pieces
  * 2 oz Ghirardeli semisweet chocolate pieces
  * 1/4 cup whole milk powder
  * 1/4 cup skim milk powder
  * 1 cup Trader Joe&#8217;s roasted hazelnuts
  * 1/2 tsp salt
  * 3/4 tsp Madagascar vanilla
  * 1 tbsp soy lecithin
  * 2 tbsp avocado oil

Melt chocolate in double boiler. Add milk powders to double boiler and stir thoroughly. Grind hazelnuts to paste in food processor. Add remaining ingredients (except chocolate mixture) to food processor and blendÂ briefly. Add chocolate and blend until smooth. Store in refrigerator.
