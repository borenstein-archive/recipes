One of my favorite summer breakfasts is a big fruit salad with some Greek yogurt or cottage cheese and a bit of cereal. But neither yogurt nor cottage cheese ever seemed quite right, because the cottage cheese texture and saltiness were off, and the Greek yogurt can be too sour.

So I tried mixing some Nido powdered milk into 2% Fage Greek yogurt. The result was sublime&#8211;with a bit of maple syrup, it was almost like frosting. It went amazingly well with blueberries.
