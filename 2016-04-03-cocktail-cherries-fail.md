I would have used all brandy, but I ran out. I’ll know how these come out in a couple of weeks. **<u>UPDATE: These came out very poorly; do not make again.</u>**

2 cups cherries, washed but with stems and pits intact

¾ cup sugar

½ cup brandy

½ cup TJ vodka

¼ tsp SS lemon extract

Bring all ingredients but cherries to a boil. Reduce heat and stir until sugar is dissolved. Add cherries. Let cool somewhat. Transfer to a 24 oz jar. Refrigerate at least a few days before serving. Between the sugar and the booze, I imagine this will last indefinitely.
