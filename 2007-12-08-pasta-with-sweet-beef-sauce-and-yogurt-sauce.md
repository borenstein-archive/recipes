The inspiration for using a cumin-based sweet beef sauce with a yogurt sauce came from the Afghani pumpkin dish, &#8216;kaddo.&#8217; (Eventually, I&#8217;m going to get around to making that.) The beef sauce is sweet and spicy, while the yogurt sauce is sour and rich, and the interplay is unique and enjoyable. I&#8217;m not sure if this dish is for everyone; I&#8217;d be interested to get feedback on it before I serve it to a group.

The yogurt sauce is also great on its own with macaroni or tortellini.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span>  
Pasta and beef sauce: 

  * 1 lb. ground beef or lamb
  * 1 lb. frozen or fresh okra, cut or whole
  * 1 large can (about 1.5 lbs) chick peas, drained and washed
  * 1 large onion, chopped
  * 1 lb. penne pasta<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
  * 1 tbsp. cumin
  * 1 tbsp. chopped garlic
  * 1 tsp. ground mustard seed
  * 2 tbsp. molasses
  * 1 tbsp. cinnamon
  * cayenne pepper
  * 3 tbsp balsamic vinegar

Yogurt sauce: 

  * 1 lb (1/2 carton) non-fat yogurt
  * 2 tbsp. chopped garlic
  * 1/2 cup ground Parmesan
  * 2 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil
  * 1/2 head fresh dill, finely chopped
  * Lots of fresh black pepper

<span style="font-weight: bold;">RECIPE:</span> 

  1. Cook the pasta and set aside.
  2. While the pasta is cooking, combine all ingredients for yogurt sauce in a bowl and set aside.
  3. Heat some olive oil in a saucepan. Add onions once very hot; sauté until golden.
  4. Add the garlic, beef and spices; sauté the mixture over high heat until meat is browned.
  5. Add the okra, garbanzos, vinegar and molasses; sauté another couple of minutes.
  6. Reduce heat to low; simmer, covered, for another 5 minutes.
  7. Stir in pasta.

Serve the pasta with the yogurt sauce. I usually serve the hot pasta with the cold yogurt sauce, but you may prefer to gently warm the yogurt sauce in a small saucepan. I wouldn&#8217;t get it too hot, though.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">PAIRINGS:</p> 

<p>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span>Use a full-bodied red, but make sure that it isn&#8217;t too acidic. Acidity tends to play poorly off of cumin dishes, especially when they are spicy.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br /></span>
