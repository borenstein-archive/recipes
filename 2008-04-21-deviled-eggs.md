If you must serve boiled eggs, you might as well make them interesting. (Why anyone would serve boiled eggs outside of a religious ritual is entirely beyond me.)

Since aioli contains raw egg yolk, it is important to serve the deviled eggs on the same day that you make the aioli and make sure that you keep the eggs refrigerated until ready to serve.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 1 dozen eggs
  * 3 tbsp. horseradish aioli (see below)
  * 1 tbsp. spicy mustard
  * 2 tbsp. lemon juice
  * 3 tbsp. chopped fresh parsely
  * Salt to taste

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Bring a pot of water to a rolling boil. To this, add all of the eggs and allow to steep for 13 minutes. Remove from hot water and immediately steep in ice water for several minutes.
  2. Remove the shells, being careful not to damage the egg in the process.
  3. With a sharp knife, cut each egg in half. Remove the hard-boiled yolk to a bowl; reserve the whites.
  4. Combine the yolks with all remaining ingredients, pressing down with the back of a fork.
  5. Put the filling into a resealable bag. Cut one corner off the bag at a 30 degree angle, creating an aperture a little narrower than the yolk-sized hole in an egg white.
  6. Squeeze filling from bag into each egg with a circular motion. Smooth gently if necessary.

Sprinkle with paprika and garnish with additional parsely. Serve on the same day.
