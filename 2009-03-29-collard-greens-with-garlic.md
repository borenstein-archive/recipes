Collard greens are a bit like kale; they have an astringent taste that offsets fatty or fried foods quite elegantly. You often find them overcooked and slightly sweet; if this is your idea of collards, you&#8217;ve been missing out.

Here, I pan-fry them very quickly with salt to draw out some of the vegetal flavor while retaining a good deal of crunch.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 2 bunches collard greens
  * 6 cloves garlic, roughly chopped<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>[](http://tofuvavohu.blogspot.com/2008/06/how-to-crush-garlic.html)
  * 1/2 tsp salt
  * 4 tbsp. olive oil

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Lay several leaves of collards on top of each other in alternating directions. Roll tightly; cut the roll into narrow ribbons using a chef&#8217;s knife.
  2. In a glass bowl or other non-reactive container, combine the greens and the salt.
  3. Heat the olive oil in a deep skillet over a medium flame until very hot but not smoking. Add the garlic; it will crisp instantly.
  4. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Immediately </span>add the greens, covering for 30 seconds. They will wilt substantially.
  5. Uncover and continue to cook, turning constantly, for another 1-2 minutes or until softened but still crunchy.

Serve immediately.
