Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, our family had to make Thanksgiving all for ourselves this year. We took it as an opportunity to develop our own menu, as well as our own format: not one massive meal, but three reasonably sized ones with more dishes becoming available throughout the day.

Breakfast:
