Encouraged by the really excellent results with the red ale and bourbon mustard, I decided to make a straight bourbon batch with what I had around. I read somewhere that Four Roses bourbon was a good value for cooking, so I picked up a bottle and used that.

I suspect I&#8217;m going to wish that I had more yellow mustard seeds, and that I had used a dash of honey, but I used what I had at hand. I used a slightly higher vinegar-to-booze ratio to offset the bitter heat of the whiskey. Also a higher salt concentration, because this has been annoying me.

Ingredients:

3 oz yellow mustard seeds
  
4.5 oz brown mustard seeds
  
7 oz red vinegar
  
9 oz Four Roses bourbon
  
1/2 tsp whole peppercorns (why not?)
  
1 tbsp fine sea salt
  
1/2 tsp ground allspice
  
1/4 tsp cinnamon

Combined all ingredients in an airtight, non-reactive container; will grind after 2-3 days.
