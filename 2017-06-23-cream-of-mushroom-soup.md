This came out exceptionally well. It tastes much, much richer than it is.

  * 2 lbs assorted fresh mushrooms (go to a Chinese grocery store)
  * 6-8 scallions, sliced, green parts removed
  * 1 smallÂ red potato
  * 1 large head of cauliflower
  * 1 lb lowfat cottage cheese (I used Breakstone&#8217;s)
  * 4 cups (1 package) unsalted vegetable stock (I used Kitchen Basics)
  * 2 tbsp powdered whole milk (I use Nido)
  * 4 tbsp butter
  * Asafetida
  * Pinch of saffron
  * Salt and pepper

  1. Clean and loosely cut up the cauliflower and potato. Place in a pot with the vegetable stock and the saffron. Simmer until everything is soft.
  2. Meanwhile, clean and chop all of the mushrooms. This can take a little while.
  3. When all the mushrooms are ready, heat the butter over medium heat in a wide-rimmed pot. Add the asafetida and let it dissolve, scraping constantly to avoid burning. Add the scallions and let soften for about 30 seconds, still scraping constantly.
  4. Increase heat to maximum and add all the mushrooms. Add a generous amount of salt, and continue to cook, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms begin to give up their liquid. Reduce heat to medium and continue to cook until the mushrooms have lost much of their volume.
  5. Combine the mushroom mixture, cauliflower mixture, and all remaining ingredients in a blender until extremely smooth. You may have to work in batches.
  6. Serve immediately.The soup is best on the day it is made.
