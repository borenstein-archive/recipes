_This is HK&#8217;s favorite. It takes a few tries to get the hang of the timing, but it&#8217;s worth it&#8211;this recipe tastes super-decadent and yet is very high in protein and low in fat._

_I made this recipe with a thermometer, and I found that even after adding the eggs, the temperature did not drop below 160F. The eggs began to set with no additional heat, and were sufficiently hot as to be considered &#8220;cooked food.&#8221; (The eggs and egg whites were both refrigerated.)_

  * 1 tsp pistachio extract
  * ¼ tsp SS rose water
  * 1 tsp Madagascar B vanilla
  * 6 tbsp sugar
  * 3 cups leftover brown rice
  * 4 ½ cups 2% lactaid milk
  * 1 ½ cups egg white
  * 3 large eggs
  * A shake of cinnamon
  * ¼ tsp salt

Put everything but the eggs, egg whites, and pistachios into a pot. Crank up heat to maximum and whisk frequently until the milk begins to foam up. The milk will rise up very quickly once it begins to foam! Right before it gets too high, turn off the heat and begin adding the egg mixture in a steady stream while whisking constantly. (An egg beater might be helpful here.) Continue beating until eggs are set, then transfer immediately to another vessel to prevent overcooking.

**UPDATE:** I didn&#8217;t make this for about two months after I wrote the revised recipe above. The next two times I made it&#8211;on a different stove&#8211;the result was unpleasantly gritty, like the eggs were getting cooked instead of custardized. So I did a little research.

  * Milk boils at 212.3, and custard sets between 160 and 180, so adding the eggs slowly just after it&#8217;s boiled will be too hot for the eggs. I wonder if my previous stove, which was much more powerful, was heating the bottom of the pan differently so that the top was still cool.
  * You really need the yolks, so don&#8217;t try to get away with mostly (or all) egg white, as I did.
