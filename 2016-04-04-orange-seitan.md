I would consider using sugar-free plum or apricot jam in place of marmalade. Other than that, written as it should next be executed, not as originally executed. Differences: I had tangerine juice, not orange juice; I used less cornstarch because I was low on it; I added the sugar after the fact.

  * 1 cup tangerine juice (=orange)
  * 200g Crofter’s organic Seville orange spread (=sugar-free marmalade). Consider plum or apricot jam.
  * 6 tbsp low sodium soy sauce
  * 4 tbsp cornstarch (all I had)
  * 6 cloves of garlic, smashed
  * 2 tbsp sugar
  * About 1/3” ginger, minced
  * Asafetida
  * 2 tbsp oil
  * 2 lb grilled mushrooms (about 3 lb raw mushrooms, cooked)
  * 2 packages Ray’s seitan, drained
  * 1 cup cashews
  * 1 can bamboo shoots
  * 1 can baby corn
  * 1 can water chestnuts

Combine orange juice, marmalade/jam, soy sauce, cornstarch and sugar in a sealed jar with a shaker ball and blend thoroughly. Set aside.

In a frying pan, heat oil. Add asafetida and allow to temper. Add ginger and garlic, and fry until golden. Add mushrooms and seitan and cook until heated through. Add cashews, bamboo shoots, baby corn, and water chestnuts. Cook for several more minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the sauce and cook until thickened.

Serve with rice and broccoli.
