This is essentially a banana bread that I have managed to make eminently unhealthy. I think it would be very excellent with a cream cheese frosting, but I don&#8217;t have any cream cheese, so I&#8217;m just going to have to imagine that for the moment.

Influenced by [this banana bread recipe](http://www.elise.com/recipes/archives/001465banana_bread.php).

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 6 large ripe bananas, mashed
  * 1 1/4 cups sugar
  * 2 1/4 cups flour
  * 1 cup chopped walnuts
  * 1 cup bittersweet chocolate (as always, 60% cocao recommended)
  * 2 medium eggs, beaten
  * 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
  * 1 tbsp. vanilla
  * 2 tsp. baking soda
  * 1/2 tsp salt
  * 1 tsp. ground nutmeg

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
  2. Combine the mashed bananas, sugar, melted butter, eggs and vanilla in a mixing bowl.
  3. Add the eggs and mix thoroughly.
  4. Add the baking soda, salt, nutmeg, and flour. Mix thoroughly and evenly so that no lumps exist.
  5. Finally, add the walnuts and chocolate chips.
  6. Butter (or spray with cooking spray) a nonstick baking pan. Transfer the batter to the pan.
  7. Bake for 35 minutes or until set. You can tell that it&#8217;s set if you stick in a toothpick or a knife and it comes out clean (except maybe for a little butter or chocolate).
  8. Remove from oven and allow to cool for 45 minutes before serving.

If anyone wants to try making this with cream cheese frosting, please apprise me of the results.
