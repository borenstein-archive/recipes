I had lots of bananas, so I thought it was time to experiment with banana bread. But I don&#8217;t want all that carb-y badness. So I made high-protein banana bread based on [a couple](http://www.nutritionistinthekitch.com/protein-packed-banana-bread-can-be-gluten-free/) [of recipes](http://dessertswithbenefits.com/banana-bread-no-7/). I thought they came out great. My only changes would be use 1/2 tsp salt and only 10 drops of Stevia.

  * 120g white flour
  * 28g almond meal
  * 120g oat bran
  * 40g Jarrow whey protein
  * 1/2 tsp cinnamon
  * 1 tbsp cocoa powder
  * 1 tsp cassia cinnamon
  * 1 tbsp baking powder
  * 1/4 tsp salt
  * 3 large, overripe bananas (350g)
  * 1 large, overripe pear (125g)
  * 1/2 cup lowfat cottage cheese (120g)
  * 1/2 cup milk
  * 1/4 cup butter
  * 1/2 cup egg white
  * 30g molasses
  * 15 drops stevia
  * 1 tbsp homemade vanilla
  * 60g mini chocolate chips

Preheat oven to 375F. Blend everything but the chocolate chips. Add chocolate chips and pulse on ~2-3 to mix in. Spray a muffin pan with canola oil and pour in batter. Bake for 30 minutes.
