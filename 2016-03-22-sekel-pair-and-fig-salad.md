Heather liked this a lot. Adapted from: <http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/1457/marinated-fig-and-mozzarella-salad>

  * 2 sekel pears
  * Field greens
  * 7 fresh green figs (ideally 8, but one was spoiled)
  * 3 oz Kerrygold Cashel Blue Farmhouse
  * 4 tbsp Giuseppi Giusti &#8220;2 gold medals&#8221; (thin, sweet &#8212; medals are the quality scale for this brand, 1 to 5)
  * 1/4 tsp lemon extract
  * 1 tbsp lemon juice
  * 2 tbsp Whole Foods Greek olive oil (green, slightly spicy)

Mix all the liquids together. Trim the stems of the figs and cut into quarters lengthwise. Stand up the figs in a small bowl, peel side toward one another (to maximize inside surface area exposed) and pour liquids over them. Let stand 30-60 minutes (not more).

&nbsp;

Put field greens into bowls. Quarter, trim and slice the Sekel pears. Slice the cheese into thin triangles. (It is sticky &#8212; perhaps slice while still very cold, then set out for awhile?) Arrange the pear slices, fig quarters, and cheese over the greens. Drizzle the balsamic mix over the salads, serve immediately.
