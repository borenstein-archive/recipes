I tried [this recipe in](http://www.sushifaq.com/recipes/gingermiso.htm) an effort to get that Japanese restaurant salad dressing that I love so much. It didn&#8217;t work, but I did figure out how to make that tasty dipping sauce they always sample at Whole Foods, but that I&#8217;m too cheap to buy. This is actually a lot tastier, with no weird ingredients.

Wasabi takes it in a whole other direction that&#8217;s also quite nice.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 4 tbsp light miso
  * 2&#8243; chunk of ginger, peeled
  * 2 tbsp sesame oil
  * 3/4 cup olive oil
  * 2 tbsp lime juice
  * 2 tbsp rice vinegar
  * <span style="font-weight: bold;">Variation</span>: add 1-2 tbsp prepared wasabi.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Combine everything but oil in the blender; run blender on low until a thick paste is formed.
  2. While blender continues to run, add oil in a very slow stream until a fluffy, creamy aioli is formed.

Serve with crudites. Keeps well in refrigerated.
