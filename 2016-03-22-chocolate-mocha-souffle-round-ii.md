4 oz unsweetened chocolate

  * 3 tbsp butter, melted
  * 1 cup egg white
  * 2 cups nonfat cottage cheese
  * 1 tbsp homemade vanilla (October batch, wide-cut, Madagascar B 1x)
  * 1 tsp molasses
  * 2/3 cup flour
  * ½ cup sugar
  * 1 tbsp cocoa powder
  * 1 tbsp very fine coffee (finest setting on Baratza grinder; decaf is fine)
  * ½ tsp salt
  * 1 tsp baking powder

<u></u>Proceeded as in previous batch. Batter was simply incredible as a mousse—so much so that I set about 2/3 cup aside immediately to be used as such. I may ultimately turn this into a mousse recipe. Anyway, I sprayed a muffin tin with canola spray and put half of the remaining batter into 6 of the muffins. Then I mixed ¼ cup milk into the remaining batter and put that into the muffin tin as well. This milk-diluted half looked and tasted more like a batter and less like a mousse. Put into a 325F oven for 40 minutes. We liked the milk version better, but OH MY GOD the mousse is the winner by a hundred miles. Good with whipped cream, though not necessary. HK says: “NQ would love this.”

The muffin is pretty good in its own right, definitely more portable and convenient, and would make a reasonable breakfast (whereas the pudding/mousse feels absurdly decadent, even though they are nutritionally identical). So don’t write off the muffins, but definitely keep that mousse in mind—it is amazing.

Note: the pudding tastes plenty sweet as it is. The muffins, however, taste a bit undersweet.
