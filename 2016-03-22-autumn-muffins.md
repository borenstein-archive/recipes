  * 3 small apples
  * 5-6 quite small carrots
  * 1 large-ish sweet potato
  * Juice of 1 lemon
  * ½ cup orange juice
  * 3 capfuls of SS 2x Madagascar vanilla
  * 100g oat bran
  * 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
  * 1 tbsp baking powder
  * 200g nonfat cottage cheese
  * 42g (1.5 oz) egg white protein (which may be just egg white powder – need to verify)
  * 1 cup and a bit of egg white
  * 75g dried apricots.
  * A couple big shakes of cinnamon
  * A shake of salt
  * 2 tbsp canola oil
  * 40g bourbon soaked walnuts
  * 50g commercial dried cranberries

  1. Wash and scrub all the vegetables. DO NOT PEEL. Cut the carrots into 2mm rounds. Halve the sweet potato lengthwise and cut into 2mm slices. Quarter and core the apples, then slice into 10mm slices.
  2. Put the vegetables into a pressure cooker with lemon juice and orange juice. Pressure cook for two minutes on high, quick release.
  3. Put 400g of the drained vegetable mixture into the food processor, putting the rest away all other ingredients except walnuts and cranberries.  (Yes to the apricots – they get ground up for sweetness.) Blend very thoroughly until smooth.
  4. I put half of these directly into a buttered muffin pan. (I buttered with olivio.)
  5. The other half, I added 1-2 tbsp maple syrup and then baked. DB liked the sweeter one, finding in just sweet enough. HK found it not sweet enough, and preferred the less sweet ones so she could top them.

Notes:

  * Use lemon zest
  * Prepare fewer veggies, so that I don’t have to reserve any
  * Not sure if the orange juice makes a difference
  * Bourbon soaked walnuts seemed to make a difference. If there aren’t any, add bourbon directly.
  * Commercial cranberries bc the homemade ones were too precious to waste, but nothing wrong with using them.
