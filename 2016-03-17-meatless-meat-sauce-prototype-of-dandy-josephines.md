_This is &#8220;as executed,&#8221; not as recommended. I can measure things more carefully next time._

Preheat oven to 350F.
  
Cut six tomatoes in half. Put a splash of olive oil (like 1-1.5 tbsn) in each of two roasting dishes, then arrange six tomato halves in each one. Roast for 2 hours or so, until the tomatoes are mottled red and brown, and are shrivelled and really sweet.

Scrape the tomatoes off the roasting pan and put them in the blender. Add water, a bit at a time, until it will blend. Then keep adding water until it&#8217;s the thickness of marinara sauce. Add really high quality aged balsamic, 1 tsp at a time, until the balance of sweet and sour seems right. I think I got to 3 or 4 tsp, but I suspect it depends on the ripeness of the tomatoes, etc.

Add about 2 tsp of dried porcini, 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes (reduced from 1/2 &#8212; you may skip), and 5-6 capers to blender. Blend.

Mince 6-8 cloves of garlic. Place these in a mortar and pestle with 1/2 tsp asafetida, 1 tbsp olive oil, and a couple shakes of salt. Mash until it is a paste.

Heat 2-3 more tbsp of olive oil in a saucepan to medium-high. Add the garlic mixture and fry, scraping constantly with a spatula, until golden.

Immediately add 2/3 of a package of Quorn crumbless and increase heat to high. Scrape regularly with spatula. You may need to add more olive oil if it gets too dry.

When the quorn looks like cooked hamburger, add the tomato mixture. After pouring out as much as you can into the pot, add a bit more water to the stuff at the bottom and pour that in.

Add 2 tbsp of grated parmesan. Adjust salt and balsamic to taste.

Reduce heat to low, cover and let simmer for 10 more minutes.
