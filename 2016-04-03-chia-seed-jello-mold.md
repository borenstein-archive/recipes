At last, a way to realize the potential of the jello molds that HK and DB’s mothers each make, which are full of fruit yet somehow not that healthy (or vegetarian). HK wants less nuts in this, and we will also try chia flour instead of whole seeds.

As you will note in the recipe below, you want to do the chia seeds and berries the day before you do the rest of the fruit.

  * 4 small apples (a bit over 1 lb)
  * 4 navel oranges
  * 2 medium carrots
  * 1 package frozen mixed berries
  * 6 tbsp chia seeds
  * ½ cup walnuts, chopped and toasted

Microwave the frozen berries in a glass bowl or measuring cup for 3 minutes. It will be very liquidy—that’s good. Mash them up as much as practical with the back of a fork. Stir in the chia seeds, cover, and refrigerate for at least 8 hours.

The next day, peel and chop the apples and oranges. Peel and grate the carrots. Stir all ingredients together. Refrigerate until chilled.
