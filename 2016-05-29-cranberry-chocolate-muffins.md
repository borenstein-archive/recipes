DB liked these but HK thought they were much too sour. I think it would be better to add more white flour to help hold these together next time. Try maybe 180g next time.

&nbsp;

  * 120g white flour
  * 28g almond meal
  * 120g oat bran
  * 40g Jarrow whey protein
  * 1 tbsp baking powder
  * 1/4 tsp salt
  * 500g fresh (or frozen) cranberries
  * 180g nonfat cottage cheese (what I had)
  * 1/2 cup milk
  * 1/4 cup butter
  * 1/2 cup egg white
  * 30g molasses
  * 25 drops stevia
  * 1/2 tbsp homemade vanilla
  * 1/2 tbsp rum seconds vanilla paste
  * 60g mini chocolate chips
  * 1 tsp coconut extract

Preheat oven to 375F. Blend everything but the chocolate chips. Add chocolate chips and pulse on ~2-3 to mix in. Spray a muffin pan with canola oil and pour in batter. Bake for 30Â minutes.
