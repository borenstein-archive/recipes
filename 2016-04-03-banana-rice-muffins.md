_This is a seriously out-there experiment. Ingredients as executed. It actually came out pretty good, if slightly dry. I am inclined to put in some mini chocolate chips, which will provide some fat (and thus some moisture) while making this a much more exciting food. They are currently 130 calories each. You could get a good amount of chocolate in there adding 50 calories worth of mini chips each._

  * 1 tbsp Madagascar B vanilla
  * 550g (3.5 cups) leftover brown rice
  * 730g (~3 cups) mashed bananas
  * 60g (1/3 cup) powdered buttermilk
  * 40g (1/3 cup) powdered skim milk
  * 45g (1/3 cup) powdered whole milk
  * 1 ½ cups egg white
  * 3 large eggs
  * 1.5 tsp Cassia cinnamon
  * ½ tsp mace
  * ½ tsp salt
  * Fresh nutmeg (hard to measure)
  * 25g molasses

Preheated oven to 350F.

Put everything except rice and nutmeg in a bowl. Whisk like crazy. Grate in nutmeg until it’s just more than perceptible. Remember, it gets a lot stronger as it cooks. This made way too much batter for the muffin pan—even with the amount of batter I ate raw (probably about 1 muffin worth) I was able to fill my smallest cast iron pan with batter as well. Let’s say 17 muffins worth.

Anyway, I buttered the muffin pan and the small cast iron pan, poured in the batter in, and put it all in the oven for 45 minutes.
