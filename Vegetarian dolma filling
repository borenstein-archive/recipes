- 2/3 cup textured vegetable protein (TVP)
- 1 + 1/3 cup basmati rice
- 1 cup French lentils (the brown ones)
- 1 bag quorn grounds
- 2 cloves of garlic, smashed (I used from 1/2 tbsp from a jar)
- 1 medium red onion, finely minced
- 1 bunch parsley, stemmed and minced
- 1/2 bunch mint, stemmed and minced
- Zest of 1 lemon
- Juice of 2 lemons
- Olive oil
- Salt to taste

1. In an Instant Pot, combine the TVP, basmati rice, 1-2 tbsp olive oil, the garlic, and 2 cups of water. Pressure cook on high for 4 minutes, natural release. Allow to cool; can be made ahead.
1. Pick over and rinse the lentils. Place in a pot with 2 cups of water. Simmer, covered, for 30-45 minutes (until tender enough to eat on their own). Allow to cool; can be made ahead.
1. Sautee the quorn grounds in olve oil until thoroughly cooked. Add rice mixture, then lentils, then all other ingredients. **We do not want the herbs or the onion to get cooked!**

Observations:
- I ate it as-is and enjoyed it thoroughly, but you could definitely put it into grape leaves if you had the occasion. 
- Very convincingly like dolmas made with beef. If desired, consider adding more fat for greater realism. Coconut oil has some similarities to animal fat (including being bad for your heart), so that's an option. Unfortunately, I know no way to fake the taste or texture of lamb.
