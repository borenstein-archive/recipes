Butternut squash has a flavor profile related to pumpkin (the squash is milder and softer). Generally speaking, then, if something works with pumpkin, it will probably work with butternut squash.

This butternut squash bread is based on [the recipe found here](http://www.seasonalrecipes.com/rec/recipe196.butternutsquashbread.html). It was very good, but needs tweaking. I followed the first posted suggestion to make it less sweet, and still found it bordering on saccharine; and there was not enough salt to emphasize the squash.

This proportions below are for my next attempt, based on my current impressions; I have not yet tried them this way.

I have not yet decided how best to prepare the squash itself. The successful methods I&#8217;ve used are to peel it, cut it into pieces and boil it until soft (easy, but nutrient-robbing); or to cut it in half, remove the seeds and bake, cut side down, at 425 for 45 minutes. Steaming would probably be great, but I don&#8217;t have a steamer. I once tried peeling it and then baking it, but the exposed part formed an unpalatable outer &#8220;skin&#8221; that could not be pureed.

A variant I would like to try is to add shredded carrots or zucchini (or both?) to the batter.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS</span>: 

  * 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
  * 3/4 cup brown sugar
  * 3/4 cup granulated sugar
  * 1/2 tsp. baking powder
  * 2 tsp. baking soda
  * 1 1/2 tsp. salt
  * 1 tsp. ground cloves
  * 1 tsp. nutmeg
  * 1 tsp. cinnamon
  * 1 tsp. ground ginger
  * 1 cup water
  * 3/4 cup vegetable oil
  * 2 1/2 cups butternut squash, cooked and mashed
  * 4 large eggs, beaten
  * 1 tsp. vanilla

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Preheat oven to 325. Spray three nonstick 9&#8243; x 5&#8243; loaf pans (or three 6-muffin tins) with nonstick spray.
  2. Combine dry ingredients in a bowl and mix thoroughly.
  3. Add remaining ingredients and mix until there are no lumps.
  4. Fill each loaf pan half-full with batter. (Fill muffin tins 2/3 full.)
  5. For loaves, bake for about 70 minutes; for muffins, about 35 minutes. The bread is done when a toothpick comes out clean.

Allow to cool on a rack briefly before serving.
