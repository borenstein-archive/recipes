_Might want to use more mushrooms. Add broccoli. Sauce right now is weak/watery. Maybe start with 2x as much and boil it down somewhat. Probably add some tamari. What about some miso, which would add both flavor and salt?_

  * 2 packages of Ray’s Seitan, liquid reserved, cut into ¾” cubes
  * 350g crimini mushrooms, cleaned and trimmed, whole
  * 20oz can chunk pineapple, juice reserved
  * 5 oz (drained weight == 1 can) sliced bamboo shoots
  * 5 oz (drained weight == 1can) water chestnuts
  * 8 oz (drained weight == 1 can) cut baby corn
  * 4 oz mung bean sprouts
  * 6 tbsp brown sugar
  * 6 tbsp unseasoned rice wine
  * 2 tbsp olive oil
  * 3 tbsp cornstarch dissolved into 3 tbsp water

Sautee the mushrooms in the olive oil. Add the brown sugar, rice wine, seitan liquid, and pineapple juice. Allow to simmer until somewhat thickened. Add seitan, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, and baby corn and simmer for several minutes. Stir in cornstarch mixture and allow to simmer for 2-3 minutes more. Finally, add the mung beans and simmer for 2 minutes.

Good condiments: crushed peanuts, fish sauce, chili paste. Serve over brown rice and/or shredded cabbage.
