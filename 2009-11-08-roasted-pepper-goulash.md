I&#8217;ve made this incredible stew three times. So far, I&#8217;ve had some &#8220;paprika cream&#8221; on hand, so the recipe below is a slight adaptation. I am pretty sure it will come out excellent, but I&#8217;ll be checking it soon to make sure. Based on Cooks Illustrated, December 2008. My major change was to emphasize fresh peppers over paprika.

Note: don&#8217;t even consider adding sour cream, you&#8217;ll blow away half the flavor profile. I prefer water to canned broth for this recipe, since the flavors are so delicate and refined. Do not serve with a strongly-flavored side; stick to noodles.

  * 2 lbs beef shoulder chuck, cut into 1 1/2&#8243; pieces
  * 4-5 carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2&#8243; pieces
  * 2 medium onions, diced
  * 3 ripe red bell peppers, halved and seeds removed
  * 2 tbsp sweet paprika
  * 1 tsp coarse salt (I use sea salt)
  * 1 tbsp tomato paste
  * 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
  * 1 cup water or broth as needed (see below)
  * Olive oil for sauté
  * Salt to taste

  1. Broil the red peppers on low for 10-15 minutes or until the skins are just beginning to have little flecks of blackened regions. Turn over and broil for another 10 minutes.
  2. Preheat the oven to 325º F.
  3. Combine the red peppers, paprika, vinegar and tomato paste in a food processor. Set aside.
  4. In a non-metallic bowl, combine meat and coarse salt, mixing to coat evenly. Allow to rest for 15 minutes.
  5. In an oven-safe stew pot, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Sauté onions and carrots for 10 minutes, turning frequently.
  6. Increase temperature to high. Add red pepper mixture and cook, turning frequently, for 2 more minutes.
  7. Stir in the beef until evenly coated. Cover (with oven-safe lid!) and place in oven.
  8. Cook for 2 1/2 hours, stirring twice.
  9. Remove from oven and add enough water (or broth) to bring liquid level near the top. Adjust salt to taste.
 10. Return to the oven for another 30 minutes.

Allow to cool slightly before serving.
