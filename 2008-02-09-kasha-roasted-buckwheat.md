<span style="font-family:arial;">Kasha is a traditional preparation of buckwheat groats prepared in stock with mushrooms, onions and (sometimes) meat. I love kasha. I think the better the broth you use, the deeper the flavor is, and also the nutrients.</p> 

<p>
  I love to cook a meat or dark poultry to go into the kasha. I make a really strong broth first. I make either a beef broth or a chicken broth. Then, the next day, or later that day, brown the meat you want to use: like flanken or chuck or turkey thighs or whatever you use, and then simmer it (poach) in the broth (strained) for a few hours till it is falling apart and wonderful. Strain the broth again (if necessary) . This recipe uses 4 cups. Put it aside for the kasha. It has to be BOILING<br />only at the point when you add it to the pan with the vegetables and the egg/kasha mixture.Cut the meat up and keep warm and save to add to the kasha in the end.

  <span style="font-style: italic;">Kasha Varniskes</span> is kasha with bow-tie noodles. I cook two cups dry noodles and drain and keep to add at the end with the meat.

  <span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE (4/18/09): Do not wash the groats, or else they will absorb some of that water while cooking with the eggs and end up soggy.</p>

  <p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="font-family:arial;">2 large eggs</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="font-family:arial;">1 cup chopped onions</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="font-family:arial;">1 cup chopped mushrooms</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="font-family:arial;">4 cups broth, hot</span>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:</span> 
      
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a large saute or frying pan with a cover, cook the onions and mushrooms in oil until they are very soft and fully cooked, and smell great. You can add salt and pepper to them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep this mixture warm until you are ready to add the hot kasha/egg mixture and the boiling broth to it.
        </li>
        <li>
          KASHA : Beat 2 large eggs in a bowl. Add 2 cups dry kasha and use a fork to stir together until the kasha groats are all coated with egg.
        </li>
        <li>
          Into another HOT (NON STICK )skillet ( yes, there are a lot of pots and pans and bowls for this ) toss the coated kasha groats. Cook over high heat 2-3 minutes,stirring,until the egg has dried on the kasha , the groats are separate and hot to the back of your finger.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now, make sure that the broth is boiling, or get it boiling. ( Don&#8217;t let it sit there boiling because you will lose some and there will be less than 4 cups).
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the kasha/egg mixture to the frying pan with the mushrooms and onions (which you have thoughtfully heated up again) . Pour in the hot broth. Let it come back to a little boil, and then cover and turn down the heat and simmer for 7-10 minutes until the kasha groats are tender and the liquid is absorbed. It may take a longer time depending upon the richness of the broth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the meat , if using, and the noodles. Season.
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        Serve warm; very good left over.
