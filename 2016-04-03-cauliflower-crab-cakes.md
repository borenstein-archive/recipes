_I accidentally made something very close to this—the only difference is the addition of the old bay, mustard powder and worcestershire. I am writing down what I would do next time._

  * Half of a large head of cauliflower, broken into florets
  * 3-4 red radishes, rough chopped
  * 3 hard boiled eggs
  * 2 tbsp butter, melted
  * 3 raw eggs, beaten
  * Bread crumbs (amount described in recipe—measure next time)
  * 1 slice of bread, soaked in milk
  * Onion powder
  * Salt
  * Old bay seasoning
  * Mustard powder
  * Vegan Worcestershire sauce

  1. Preheat oven to 350.

<ol start="2">
  <li>
    Pressure-cook the cauliflower over a steamer basket for 2 minutes, then quick-release.
  </li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    Transfer the cauliflower, the (raw!) radishes, and the hard-boiled eggs to the food processor and grind until totally smooth.
  </li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    Pour the cauliflower mixture into a large mixing bowl. Shred in the soaked bread. Add the raw eggs and the melted butter. Add bread crumbs until the mixture is just thick enough to form into “crab cakes.” Add the other seasonings until the correct flavor is reached. Be sure to write down the amounts for next time.
  </li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
  <li>
    Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Spray the foil with propellant-free canola or olive oil. Make 6-10 cakes of the desired size.
  </li>
</ol>

<ol start="6">
  <li>
    Bake for about 30 minutes or until set and a bit browned on top.
  </li>
</ol>
