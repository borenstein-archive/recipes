This is a variation on a salad dressing that my mother used to make us growing up. Squeezing the shallots under running water gets rid of the chemicals that give us bad breath and making us cry, leaving only a sweet, spicy note in its place. You may also opt to include them whole.

One great thing about fresh herbs is that they intensify flavors without salt, meaning that this dressing tastes a lot saltier than it is.

The classic salad with which my mother made this dressing was a bed of Boston and Romaine lettuce with chopped walnuts and aged gruyere cheese. The gruyere <span style="font-weight: bold;">must</span> reach room temperature!

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:</span> 

  * 3/4 cup red wine vinegar (<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOT</span> balsamic!)
  * 1/2 tbsp olive oil
  * 5 oz (2 large) shallots, minced
  * 3 tbsp walnuts
  * 1 tbsp fresh chives, rough chopped
  * 1 tbsp fresh parsley, rough chopped
  * 1/2 tbsp dried tarragon
  * 1/2 tsp salt

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:</span> 

  1. In cheesecloth, squeeze out the minced shallots under running cold water for about a minute.
  2. Combine all ingredients in a blender until very smooth.

Store in the refrigerator. Serve at room temperature if possible.
