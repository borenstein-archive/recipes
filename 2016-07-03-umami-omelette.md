  * Vidalia onion, diced
  * 8 oz crimini mushrooms, scrubbed and sliced
  * 8 oz tomatoes, diced
  * 3 oz sharp cheddar
  * 2.5 cups egg white
  * 1 tbsp whole milk powder
  * 1 tbsp buttermilk powder
  * Kala namak salt
  * Fresh black pepper
  * 3 tbsp olive oil

Whisk together the egg white, milk power, and buttermilk powder. Preheat the broiler to medium.

In an oven-safe cast-iron skillet, heat olive oil over med-high heat. Add onions, kala namak salt, and black pepper, and sautee until slightly translucent. Add mushrooms, cover, and cook for several more minutes, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms have shrunk substantially. Add the tomatoes and cook for a few more minutes, stirring occasionally.

Pour the egg mixture over the vegetable mixture. Immediately grate the cheddar over the mixture with a microplane. Allow to cook for 2 minutes or so, then transfer to broiler. Broil until cheese is brown and bubbly.

It can be served immediately or eaten later.
