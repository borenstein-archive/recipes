Note: HK thought that the meatballs should be made with egg whites and breadcrumbs. Seems risky with the eggwhites (could turn rubbery). Breadcrumbs? Maybe.

Soak about a cup of porcinis in about a cup of hot water. Use the soaking liquid in place to water to prepare a batch of seitan meatballs—make about 24 meatballs from the batch. Chop the porcinis. Into a large saucepan, pour:

  * a 24 oz jar of tomato sauce (no oregano for DB’s sake)
  * 4 cups of water
  * 2 cups of white wine
  * the soaked, chopped porcinis
  * some good balsamic to taste

Bring to a gentle simmer, then add the meatballs. Simmer for about 1.5 hours, covered, until the meatballs have a very meat-like consistency.

Shut off heat and allow to sit—if you’re doing this in cold weather, put it outside or in the garage to cool slightly (with sauce). Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 and heat some water in a pot to cook pasta. After about 15 minutes, the oven should be hot and the meatballs should be slightly cooled. (I’m not sure how important the cooling step is—might be worth trying without it.)

Remove the meatballs with a tongs, shaking off each one, and put  on a broiling pan. Bake in oven for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make pasta. While that’s cooking, simmer down the sauce, adjusting seasonings to taste.
