I made baba ghannouj yesterday, first grilling the eggplants in foil packets over a 350 degree grill for about 45 minutes. The resulting eggplants were very watery, and not charred anywhere. It&#8217;s been awhile since I&#8217;ve grilled eggplant. I know I&#8217;d gotten it right in the past.

I think the three ways to try it next are:

  * No foil, direct heat only (uncovered grill)
  * No foil, direct + indirect (as I did today, just without the foil)
  * Foil, directly on coals

I am not writing down the proportions for the baba, as it got all messed up because I had to boil it down. On a related note, though, if you reduce baba ghannouj by simmering it, it doesn&#8217;t seem to hurt it&#8211;just let it cool to slightly chilled.
