The mustard from the last post reminded me of a lamb stew my mother had made growing up. She sent me a copy of the recipe (book unknown&#8211;I will ask her). She had changed basically every measurement, but the concept is the same. I changed them again according to what I had available.

INGREDIENTS:

  * 6 tbsp all-purpose flour, not sifted
  * 1 1/4 tsp salt (estimated)
  * 1/2 tsp pepper (estimated)
  * Olive oil for saute
  * 2 lbs butterflied leg of lamb, cut into 1&#8243; cubes
  * 2 lbs Russet potatoes, peeled
  * 6 tbsp homemade mustard
  * 2 tbsp lemon juice (I used bottled)
  * 2 tbsp processed chopped garlic (use 1 head fresh if time)
  * Most of one package (32 oz) Pacific low sodium beef broth&#8211;mixed use (see procedure).

  PROCEDURE:
</div>

<div>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Began heating 20 oz broth (recommended quantity) in slow cooker.
    </li>
    <li>
      Mix flour, salt, pepper in a zip-loc bag
    </li>
    <li>
      Add meat to bag and shake to coat. (Did not work&#8211;too much meat. Use mixing bowl.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat oil in wide steel pot. Brown all meat together over med-high heat, stirring occasionally until browned. (~10 minutes). <i>The oil was absorbed by the first layer of meat to make contact&#8211;not sure it actually did anything. Maybe try omitting?</i>
    </li>
    <li>
      At this point, there was a caked-on layer of flour at the bottom of the pan. I deglazed it using ~8 oz more of the beef broth. Might as well use all of it next time. Transfered deglazed mixture into slow cooker.
    </li>
    <li>
      Combined all ingredients in slow cooker.
    </li>
    <li>
      Cooked 4 hours on low.
    </li>
    <li>
      Switched to high 2 more hours.
    </li>
    <li>
      Allowed to cool, partially covered, for 1 hour before transferring to refrigerator.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <div>
    Served with wide egg noodles.

  NOTES:
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Really exceptional
    </li>
    <li>
      Recipe must have been written for very high sodium broth&#8211;this needed a lot of salt at the end
    </li>
    <li>
      Use even more mustard next time
    </li>
    <li>
      Recipe originally called for new potatoes, unpeeled; I used peeled russet because I had to minimize texture for a dental procedure.
    </li>
    <li>
      Recipe also called for frozen green peas, added 15 minutes before end of cooking; left out for same reason
    </li>
    <li>
      Recipe called for 3/4 tsp dried rosemary, which I did not have
    </li>
    <li>
      Put both back in next time
    </li>
  </ul>
