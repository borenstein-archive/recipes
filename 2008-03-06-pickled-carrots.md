If a food product comes in a nice jar&#8211;clean, a useful shape, sturdy lid&#8211;I usually run it through the dishwasher and keep it around in case I want to preserve something. These kinds of jars are perfect for an impromptu jam or pickle that you want to throw together and put in the fridge.

Here is just such a case: I forgot to put the carrots in the cholent (see below), and didn&#8217;t want them to go to waste. These sweet, spicy pickles were ready in a week, and probably would have kept much longer than that, but at the rate we&#8217;re eating them, I&#8217;ll never find out.

Since these are refrigerator pickles, you don&#8217;t need to go too crazy about acid levels and so on, but I would still sterilize the jars with boiling water just to be on the safe side.

Many pickle recipes frown on cider vinegar because it turns the brine yellow, but so do carrots, and I think cider vinegar tastes better. One bunch of carrots is good for two jars or so.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 1 bunch carrots, peeled
  * 1 tbsp. salt
  * 3 tbsp. dried dill
  * 3/4 cup apple cider vinegar
  * 2 cups water
  * 3/4 cup sugar
  * Several whole cloves of garlic, peeled (2-3 per jar)
  * Several bay leaves (2 per jar)
  * 1 fresh chili pepper per jar (optional)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Steam or boil the carrots until just slightly tender. Cut to fit your jars, or into slices.
  2. Place the carrots into the washed and sterilized jars.
  3. Stuff the garlic, bay leaves and chili peppers in between the carrots.
  4. Combine all remaining ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil, then reduce heat and allow to simmer for several minutes.
  5. Pour liquid over carrots, filling the jars to the brim, then <span style="font-weight: bold;">carefully</span> put the lids on.
  6. If you&#8217;re paranoid, you could boil the prepared jars in water for 10-15 minutes.
  7. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Refrigerate </span>for 1 week.

I would assume that these would be good for at least a month, but I really have no idea because once you open the jar, you eat them all pretty fast. They go great with hamburgers or other beef dishes.
