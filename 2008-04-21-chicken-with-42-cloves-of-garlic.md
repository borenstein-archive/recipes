When my brother in law gave me a recipe for &#8216;Chicken with Forty Cloves of Garlic,&#8217; I was more than a little skeptical. It turns out that when you cook chicken with unpeeled garlic, the chicken is not garlicky at all; rather, the garlic adopts the flavor of the chicken. The soft, schmaltzy garlic cloves can then be spread on matzo.

As for the number of cloves: my lucky number is 42. (The reason is not <span style="font-style: italic;">The Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide</span>; it&#8217;s even nerdier). As such, I couldn&#8217;t resist adjusting this recipe to that number. Again, the proportions are not that sensitive because the garlic does not actually impart a strong flavor.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 4 lbs. chicken pieces, skin on
  * 2 large onions, chopped
  * 1 apple, peeled, cored and chopped
  * 42 cloves of garlic
  * 1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped
  * 1 tsp. dried tarragon
  * 1/2 cup semi-dry red cooking wine
  * 1/2 tsp. nutmeg
  * Salt and pepper to taste

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
  2. In a four quart casserole, combine the chopped onions, apples, parsley and tarragon.
  3. Put down a layer of chicken, nestling garlic cloves in between the pieces. Repeat until all of the garlic and chicken has been placed.
  4. Combine the wine, nutmeg, salt and pepper in a jar or container and shake to combine. Drizzle over the chicken.
  5. Cover the casserole and bake for 1 1/2 hours or until juice runs golden from chicken when poked with a fork.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">PAIRINGS: </span>This dish is heavily aromatic yet delicately flavored, with mild sweetness and soft textures. I recommend a semi-dry white with just enough structure to balance the stewed vegetables.
