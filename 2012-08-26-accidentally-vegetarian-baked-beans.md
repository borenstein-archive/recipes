These were supposed to be pork and beans. (Don&#8217;t tell my rabbi.) Unfortunately, the kielbasa that I bought was spoiled when I opened it. Thanks, Shop Rite!

  It didn&#8217;t matter. Despite the imperfections that I will enumerate below, these were far and away the best baked beans I&#8217;ve ever made or had. The bourbon added a real sophistication of flavor that I would never omit again.
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  It also corrected two mistakes from my previous attempts at baked beans: first, the onions were completely caramelized, which got rid of sulfuric off notes.
</div>

</div>

<div>
  Second, the beans were cooked ahead of time. Who knew this was necessary? It seemed like 10-12 hours of cooking, after already being cooked once, would reduce them to mush. That was not the case at all.

  Based on this recipe for barbecued beans:

  I didn&#8217;t see the need to shell out for &#8220;barbecue sauce&#8221; (why?) so I adapted this recipe, which consists mostly of things already in the bean recipe:

  I also prefer large white beans (&#8220;great northern&#8221; beans) to small white beans (&#8220;navy&#8221; beans).

<div>
  INGREDIENTS:
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      1 lb dry great northern beans
    </li>
    <li>
      1 large sweet onion, chopped
    </li>
    <li>
      1/2 head garlic, roughly minced
    </li>
    <li>
      2 cups water
    </li>
    <li>
      1 1/4 cup brown sugar
    </li>
    <li>
      3/8 cup ketchup
    </li>
    <li>
      2 tbsp molasses
    </li>
    <li>
      1 cup bourbon (I used Elmer T Lee&#8211;Jim Beam probably would have been fine)
    </li>
    <li>
      1 3/4 tbsp homemade brown mustard (first batch)
    </li>
    <li>
      1/4 cup unfiltered apple cider vinegar
    </li>
    <li>
      1 1/2 tbsp red wine vinegar
    </li>
    <li>
      2 tbsp + 1 tsp&nbsp;Worcestershire&nbsp;sauce
    </li>
    <li>
      1/2 tsp paprika
    </li>
    <li>
      1/4 cup olive oil
    </li>
    <li>
      1/2 tsp salt
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div>
    DIRECTIONS:
  </div>
</div>

<div>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Pick over and rinse beans. &#8220;Quick soak&#8221; the beans by boiling them for 2 minutes, then removing from heat for 1 hour. Drain, fill with fresh water, and simmer for 30 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Meanwhile, saute the onions and garlic in the olive oil.&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
      Drain beans. Combine all ingredients in a slow cooker. Cook for 10 hours.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove beans from heat and let sit for several hours to thicken before eating.
    </li>
  </ol>

    NOTES:
  </div>
</div>

<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Way too much brown sugar. I would use half as much next time.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you don&#8217;t use any meat, it needs salt. Probably more than the 1/2 tsp I used.
    </li>
    <li>
      As I said, using such a complex (and expensive) bourbon as Elmer T. Lee was a waste. Also, it&#8217;s a bit bitter, although this was nice.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you do use meat, reduce or eliminate the oil. Brown the meat and use the drippings to saute the aromatics.
    </li>
    <li>
      One could use substantially more beans and still have plenty of sauce. I was serving it 1:1 with quinoa and there was loads of sauce for the quinoa!
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <div>
    I am going to try using 1 1/4 lbs beans next time. I am also going to try using some uncased German sausage, or other sweet garlic sausage like Andouille. I will also use only 1/2 cup brown sugar.
