<span style="font-size:100%;">For 24 pancakes:<br /></span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br /></span><span style="font-size:100%;">( 1 Vitamin C tablet )<br /></span><span style="font-size:100%;">2 1/2 pounds baking potatoes ( about 4 large potatoes)<br /></span><span style="font-size:100%;">1/2 onion<br /></span><span style="font-size:100%;">2 eggs, lightly beaten<br /></span><span style="font-size:100%;">1 teaspoon salt<br /></span><span style="font-size:100%;">1/4 teaspoon baking powder<br /></span><span style="font-size:100%;">2 Tb flour or matzoh meal<br /></span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br /></span><span style="font-size:100%;">Vegetable Oil<br /></span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br /></span><span style="font-size:100%;">Directions:<br /></span><span style="font-size:100%;"><br /></span> 

  * <span style="font-size:100%;">Place vitamin C tablet in a small bowl with 2 Tb water to dissolve. ( this step is optional&#8230; Peel the potatoes, and keep in a bowl of cold water until you are ready to shred them. ) </span><span style="font-size:100%;">Shred potatoes, using shredding blade of food processor, or by hand; place in a bowl. Stir in dissolved vitamin C. </span>
  * <span style="font-size:100%;">Shred or finely chop onion. Add to potatoes.</span>
  * <span style="font-size:100%;">Add eggs, salt , baking powder, and flour or matzoh meal; mix well.</span>
  * <span style="font-size:100%;">In a large skillet, heat 1/2 inch oil over moderately high heat. Using a slotted spoon, place about 2 Tb of batter into hot oil for each pancake. Do not crowd pancakes in pan.</span>
  * <span style="font-size:100%;">Flatten slightly with the back of the spoon and fry pancakes until golden on both sides, turning once.</span>
  * <span style="font-size:100%;">As you reach the end, squeeze batter lightly to remove excess liquid.</span>
  * <span style="font-size:100%;">After frying, remove to paper towels to drain.( Or brown paper bags with a paper towel on top. Pancakes may be kept warm in single layer in a 200 degree oven. </span><span style="font-size:100%;">May be frozen. Freeze on baking sheets in single layers. When solid, place in container. Bake in single layer on baking sheets at 450 degrees for 5-10 minutes or until crisp and bubbling.</span>

<span style="font-size:100%;">Do not double the recipe, as the last of the raw potato batter gets too starchy and brown when it sits too long. </span>

<span style="font-size:100%;">You can also coarsely grate the potatoes, and let some edges stick up and get more crispy. Or you can grate them, and then if it is too coarse for you, put them into the processor and pulse the blade a few times to more finely process them. It is up to you. Whatever you like!</span>

<span style="font-size:100%;">When you are done, your house will smell like Latkes for a while!!</span>

<span style="font-size:100%;">RECIPE: JOAN NATHAN</span>

<span style="font-size:100%;">YOU WILL NEED:</span>

<span style="font-size:100%;">10 medium potatoes</span>

<span style="font-size:100%;">2 medium onions</span>

<span style="font-size:100%;">2 large or 3 medium eggs</span>

<span style="font-size:100%;">4 Tb flour, breadcrumbs, or matzoh meal</span>

<span style="font-size:100%;">salt and pepper to taste</span>

<span style="font-size:100%;">veg oil</span>

<span style="font-size:100%;"></span> 

  * <span style="font-size:100%;">Peel the potatoes if the skin is coarse; otherwise, just clean them well. Keep them in cold water until ready to prepare the latkes.</span>
  * <span style="font-size:100%;">Starting with the onions, alternately grate some of the onions on the large holes of the grater and some of the potatoes on the smallest holes. This will keep the potato mixture from blackening, probably from the acid in the onions. Press out as much liquid as possible and reserve the starchy sediment at the bottom of the bowl. Return the sediment to the mixture. ( I have done this, and it works well: it is the potato starch, and it has a strange but fun texture. ) </span><span style="font-size:100%;">Blend potatoes with the eggs, flour, salt, and white pepper.</span>
  * <span style="font-size:100%;">Heat 1 &#8221; of oil in a frying pan. Drop about 1 Tb of mixture, fry turning once. </span>
  * <span style="font-size:100%;">She says the steel blade of a food processor or the grating blade are less painful ways of grating the potatoes and the onions. The blade makes a smooth consistency and the grater a crunchy one.I think if you are doing many, don&#8217;t grate by hand. Save it for a smaller, special batch. But, you can grate in the food processor, first some potato, and then some onion. It is the same idea.</span>
