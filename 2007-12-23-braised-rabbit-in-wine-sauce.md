This dish makes me think of Spain: specifically, of Hemingway&#8217;s elaborate descriptions of Spanish country food in <span style="font-style: italic;">For Whom The Bell Tolls.</span> Maybe that&#8217;s just me.

Anyways, I started with [this hasenpfeffer recipe](http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Hasenpfeffer-Rabbit-Stew/Detail.aspx), sticking to it pretty closely, except with about twice the herbs and aromatics. It was delicious&#8211;seven people ate six pounds of rabbit, and no one saved room for dessert&#8211;but it was too tough, and I don&#8217;t think the recipe did enough to tender up the meat.

So I&#8217;ve incorporated some steps from this [coq au vin recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,1977,FOOD_9936_29816,00.html), which uses the wine to soften the fibers of the meat overnight before braising. <span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>I have not yet tried it this way; expect updates.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 5-6 lbs rabbit meat, cut into small pieces
  * 1 1/2 cups flour, divided use
  * 2 tsp. kosher salt
  * 1 lb bacon, diced
  * 2 medium Spanish onions (about 1 1/2 cups), finely chopped
  * 4 cloves garlic, chopped
  * 1 bottle red wine (preferably Pinot Noir)
  * 3 tbsp. black currant or blackberry preserves
  * 2 bay leaves
  * 1 tsp. dried rosemary
  * 1/2 tsp. dried thyme
  * 1/4 cup lemon juice
  * Freshly ground black pepper

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Place 1 cup of flour and the kosher salt into a zip-loc bag. Coat each piece of rabbit in this mixture and set aside.
  2. In a deep metal skillet, sauté the bacon over medium-high heat until evenly browned, stirring often. Remove the bacon to a bowl <span style="font-weight: bold;">but leave all the grease in the skillet.</span>
  3. Fry the rabbit pieces, browning them on each side, and then remove them to a covered casserole or dutch oven.
  4. Sauté the onions and garlic over in what&#8217;s left of the grease, adding a little butter or oil if needed. (It&#8217;s OK if the pan&#8217;s pretty gunked up at this point.)
  5. Add 1 cup of wine to the skillet and gently scrape the sides with a plastic or wooden spatula. The cooked-on drippings should yield to your spatula as if by magic. (This is called <span style="font-style: italic;">deglazing </span>the pot.)
  6. Pour this into a bowl and combine with the rest of the wine, bacon, herbs, pepper, lemon juice, and preserves.
  7. Pour liquid over the tabbit, cover and refrigerate overnight.
  8. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The next day</span>, preheat the oven to 325.
  9. Cook the rabbit in the dutch oven for about 2 hours, maintaining a very gentle simmer. You want the lowest heat you can get while still having the liquid bubble slightly.
 10. Transfer the rabbit to a serving plate and cover it with foil to keep warm. Meanwhile, transfer the liquid to a saucepan.
 11. Remove about a cup of the liquid and combine with 1/2 cup flour. Bring the rest of the liquid to a simmer and whisk in flour mixture gradually to avoid lumps.
 12. Simmer the gravy for a few minutes, then transfer to a gravy bowl.

Serve immediately with mashed potatoes or egg noodles.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">PAIRINGS: </span>Rabbit has an intense, almost spicy gaminess, so a robust red wine such as Pinot Noir is the obvious choice.
