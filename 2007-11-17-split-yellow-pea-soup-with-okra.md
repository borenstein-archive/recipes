I love pea soup. And pea soup loves you, too. Because peas, like lentils, have a ridiculous amount of fiber and protein, and they have a fairly distinctive taste. This is especially nice on cold days. Serve with a dollop of thick yogurt and some spongy bread (like sourdough) and you will be a happy camper. Also delicious over a small grain like quinoa or couscous.<span style="font-style: italic;"></p> 

<p>
  </span><span><span style="font-weight: bold;">3/22/2008: </span>This recipe also comes out great if you add several carrots, cut into 1&#8243; pieces. I also added a tablespoon of molasses. Prepared with broth, the result is an even heartier stew that stands up on its own very impressively for a primarily vegetable-based food.</span><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></p>

    </span></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span></span> 
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 lb. dry split yellow peas, rinsed
      </li>
      <li>
        6 oz. dry-smoked bacon, chopped
      </li>
      <li>
        1 large onion, chopped
      </li>
      <li>
        1 lb frozen cut okra
      </li>
      <li>
        6 cups chicken broth or water
      </li>
      <li>
        a dash of lemon juice or cider vinegar
      </li>
      <li>
        chopped garlic to taste
      </li>
      <li>
        a dash of applesauce, apple cider or chopped apple (optional)
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 
      
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a medium-sized soup pot, cook the bacon over high heat until the fat begins to melt, stirring with a spatula to prevent burning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the chopped onion and sautee with the bacon until it begins to soften.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the okra and the garlic and them to soften as well, stirring often.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add in your peas and mix in with the vegetable-bacon mixture, allowing them to cook together dry for a minute or two while stirring vigorously with a spatula to prevent burning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the broth and all remaining ingredients and bring to a boil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once boiling, reduce heat to a simmer and let cook covered for 30-40 minutes or until peas are soft.
        </li>
        <li>
          (Optional) use an immersion blender to pulverize a <span style="font-weight: bold;">little bit</span> of the soup. (Don&#8217;t overdo this: most of the contents should still be intact.)
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        This soup is great as a leftover; just heat it up and you&#8217;re good to go.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <span style="font-weight: bold;">PAIRINGS:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span></span>Serve with full-bodied red wine, brown ale or cider (hard or soft).
