_Notes: the batter tasted amazing. HK wanted to just eat the batter as a pudding. I wish we had—the cupcakes themselves were way too dry. Make another batch for sure, but use far less flour and less egg. Nonfat ricotta isn’t a great product—no flavor, very processed; next time, just use more cottage cheese. Might consider using some powdered milk for additional creaminess. I use granulated sugar + molasses instead of brown sugar (why buy everything twice?) but you could just use brown sugar. Coffee was far more noticeable in batter form._

_ _

**Current batch:**

  * 4 oz unsweetened chocolate
  * 3 tbsp butter, melted
  * 1 ¼ cup egg white
  * 1 cup no-salt lowfat cottage cheese
  * 1 cup nonfat ricotta
  * 1 tbsp homemade vanilla (October batch, wide-cut, Madagascar B 1x)
  * 1 tsp molasses
  * ¾ cup flour
  * ½ cup sugar
  * 2 tbsp egg white powder
  * 1 tbsp cocoa powder
  * ½ tbsp very fine coffee (finest setting on Baratza grinder; decaf is fine)
  * ½ tsp salt
  * 1 tsp baking powder

Preheat oven to 350F. Heat a pot of water. Put the melted butter and the chocolate into a double boiler on top of the pot and melt. Meanwhile, put everything else into a food processor. When the chocolate is melted, add this to the food processor and process until totally smooth. Pour into a buttered 12-muffin pan and baked for 30 minutes. Toothpick was still quite wet, so baked for another 15 minutes at 325.

¼ cup milk

Prepare as above, but at 325 the whole time.
