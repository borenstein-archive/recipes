Vegetable borscht is extremely versatile. For one thing, it is fat free and extremely healthful (assuming you don&#8217;t have some kind of prejudice against carbohydrate). It is appropriate to serve it either hot or cold; if you&#8217;re kosher, it can go with dairy or meat meals depending on what you like to put in it.

Traditionally, you put things into the borscht right as you&#8217;re about to eat it, just like dressing a hamburger. And like hamburger, there are a million and one options and they all have their appeal. Here are some suggestions: 

  * Shredded red cabbage (easy either by hand or in a food processor)
  * Sliced radishes
  * A hard boiled egg
  * Half a boiled potato
  * Sour cream or cottage cheese

When I make borscht, I usually have several of these things on hand. Speaking of hands, <span style="font-weight: bold;">the beets will turn your hands purple</span>, so wear gloves if that sounds unattractive to you. (For me, it&#8217;s a point of pride.)

Beets get much sweeter as they cook, and somewhat sweeter as the soup mellows, so take it easy with the sugar. The following proportions are all approximate, as I have never measured anything when making borscht, even the first time I made it. And neither should you.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 3-4 lbs beets, peeled and cut into 3/4&#8243; cubes
  * 1 large red onion, chopped
  * 1/3 cup apple cider vinegar
  * 2 tbsp. lemon juice
  * 1/4 cup brown sugar
  * Lots of dill, fresh or chopped
  * Prepared horseradish (quantity depends on intensity, which varies greatly)
  * Cold water (see below)

  * <span style="font-style: italic;">Optional: 1/2 head red cabbage, shredded</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:</span> 

  1. Combine beets and onion in a soup pot.
  2. Add the lemon juice and vinegar.
  3. Fill up the pot with water until it&#8217;s about 1-2&#8243; higher than the vegetables.
  4. Add the remaining ingredients except cabbage (if using); bring to a boil.
  5. Reduce to low heat and let simmer, covered, for about an hour or until the beets have softened.
  6. If using cabbage, add it in and allow to cook until it has wilted somewhat.

Serve hot or cold.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">PAIRINGS: </span>Beets have a slippery, soft sweetness that pairs extremely well with acid. A structured, tart white wine such as a Muscadet or Chablis brings out some of the more delicate qualities of the beet.
