_This fake cheese recipe saved my meat-free bacon when I learned that Teese stopped making retail nacho cheese sauce. Happily, this is actually better, since it consists of fresh ingredients. Great over steamed broccoli._ 

&nbsp;

1.5 cups unsweetened almond milk

2 tbsp flour

1 tbsp cornstarch

1 tsp marmite

½ tsp ground yellow mustard

½ tsp garlic powder

½ tsp onion powder

1/8 tsp cumin

1/2 tsp paprika

½  tbsp pickled jalapenos

½ plum tomato, seeds removed

1 tbsp lemon juice

¼ tsp salt

&nbsp;

Blend all ingredients in a blender. Transfer to a saucepan and simmer until thick.
