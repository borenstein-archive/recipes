_The first time I made this, I was delighted with it (although I thought I had put too much garlic). HK was not, because I used lima beans (which she doesn’t like) and because the chik’n pieces were too big. Below is my proposed recipe for the next iteration. If herbs in duxelles are not available, one could also sautee 1-2 cups of sliced mushrooms with the onions and garlic._ 

200g roasted tomatoes

4 cups cooked great northern beans

½ head garlic, smashed

1 large Spanish onion

Asafetida

Herbs in duxelles

1 package quorn chik’n tenders (little, unbreaded pieces—could probably use any unbreaded chik’n)
