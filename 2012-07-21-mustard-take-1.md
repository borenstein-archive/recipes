I&#8217;m trying this recipe:

<http://www.saveur.com/article/Recipes/Spicy-Guinness-Mustard>

Method actually used:

1 bottle Dogfish Head Indian Brown Ale  
10 oz brown mustard seeds  
1 cup red wine vinegar  
1 tbsp. sea salt  
Freshly ground black pepper by eyeball (~ 1/2 tsp)  
~1⁄4 tsp. ground cinnamon  
~1⁄4 tsp. ground cloves  
~1⁄4 tsp. ground nutmeg  
~1⁄4 tsp. ground allspice

I did not have a 1/4 tsp. measuring spoon, so I estimated based on a 1/2 tsp. measure. Combined dry ingredients in a 4 cup Pyrex dish. Added vinegar. Added beer very slowly. It foamed vigorously. Waited for foam to settle (approx 3 minutes). Stirred gently for another 30 seconds. At this point, there was a residual foam scum at the top, which I left. Covered with rubberized plastic Pyrex lid at 6:30pm on 7/21. Placed in shaded area with ambient temperature 69-71F.

There was about 1/4&#8243; of residual liquid above the seed line after 2 days of brining. The mixture was a deep color of brown. Transferred mixture to food processor at 5:45pm on 7/23. Recommended 3 minutes of grinding left an unpleasantly coarse texture. Ground for substantially longer (perhaps 5-7 minutes total). Color and consistency changed to that of traditional deli mustard.

Overwhelmingly strong in first minutes, but had mellowed substantially after just 15 minutes. Left a small portion for some guests. By 45 minutes after grinding, the flavor of the left-out portion was sublime: sharp but multifaceted, with the blend of spices each coming out in their separate turn.

Update 7/25 AM: Flavor had mellowed enough to be used in beans and greens for breakfast. I changed my mind about the coarseness; I think it looked coarser than it was. I would grind it for less time&#8211;perhaps try the three minutes.

I might try making it with Weierbacher Heresy (Russian Imperial Stout), and double the nutmeg and allspice, leaving out the black pepper. Still brown seeds, though.
