Red potatoes

SS chaat masala

SS vadouvan

Cut the potatoes to ½” cubes.  For 1” cubes, it’s 5 minutes high in PC on steamer basket with 1 cup of water (QR). For ½” cubes, try 3 minutes and see? Toss with equal amounts of CM and Vadouvan. Measure this for next time. Maybe also season chickpeas this way?
