_I actually used ½ cup brown sugar and ½ cup confectioner’s sugar because that’s what I had. Loosely based on this recipe:_ 

[_http://www.food.com/recipe/no-pudge-brownie-clone-116219_](http://www.food.com/recipe/no-pudge-brownie-clone-116219)

_DB: “Not bad. Moisture level very good.” HK “In between: too decadent to be a muffin, too bland to be a dessert.”_

_Proposed changes for next iteration:_

  * _Important: switch to fine salt._
  * _Slightly less salt._
  * _Replace some of the flour with more PB2._
  * _More cocoa._

1 cup brown sugar

½ cup cocoa powder

¾ cup PB2

¾ cup flour

10 oz 2% fage yogurt

2/3 cup egg white

2 tbsp olive oil

4 capfuls of vanilla (~2 tsp)

½ tsp salt

¼ tsp baking soda

2 tsp cornstarch

¼ cup 2% milk

Preheat oven to 350F. Combine all ingredients in large mixing bowl. Spray a baking sheet with canola oil. Bake for 35 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean.
