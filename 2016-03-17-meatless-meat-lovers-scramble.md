**INGREDIENTS:**

  * Handful of greens (any)
  * A couple scallions, or a slice of onion, etc
  * Handful of chopped sweet peppers
  * Asafetida
  * Mushroom powder (if on hand)
  * 4 Wegman&#8217;s meatless chicken nuggets
  
    2 TJ meatless sausage patties
  * 3/4 cup egg white
  * Whole large egg
  * 1/3 cup fage 0% yogurt
  * 1 tbsp olive oil (infused with dried porcini in my case)

**DIRECTIONS:**

  1. Mix the egg, the egg white, the yogurt and the feta in a bowl.
