(Adapted from: <http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=recipe&dbid=187>)

Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t measure anything here. Low delicious ratio, but very pretty.

  * Several carrots
  * 2 smallish sweet potatoes
  * 1 pot vegetable broth
  * 3 low sodium not-chik&#8217;n boullion cubes
  * 2 small slices ginger
  * 2 Spanish onions
  * 4 large cloves garlic
  * 2 tsp honey
  * Asafetida
  * Regular salt (this could be improved, but not with a salt I have)
  * 1 can Goya coconut milk
  
    Olive oil for sautee
  * Zest and juice of one lemon
  * Keffir lime leaves

Drizzle:

  * Handful of parsley
  * Several tbsp olive oil

Peel and slice the carrots into 2mm slices. Peel, quarter the sweet potatoes and cut into 2mm slices (same size pieces as the carrots). Chop the onions fine. Turn the garlic to a paste with salt.

Put carrots, sweet potato, ginger, keffir lime, veg broth, honey, and coconut milk into pressure cooker. Pressure cook for 2 (?) minutes on high, quick release.

Heat olive oil for sautee in a saucepan. Add asafetida and let cook for a moment. Add garlic and let cook briefly. Add onion and cook until golden. Add several ladles of the broth from the carrots mixture. (I&#8217;d say keep ladling until the carrots are exposed.) Let that mixture boil down on high until it is reduced by about 50%.

Pour onion mixture back into the pressure cooker and stir. Then blend in a blender, 1/2 pitcher at a time, pouring back into the saucepan for the onions. Serve.

Drizzle: blend parsley and OO in a clean blender. Strain into a clean container. Drip in a thin stream over the food (not droplets, but continuous). Looks like Chinese calligraphy if made in straight lines.
