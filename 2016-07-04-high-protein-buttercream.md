A refinement of the yogurt-powdered milk discovery of a few days ago. I bet maple syrup would be better than simple syrup, but I don&#8217;t have any.

  * 6 tbsp 2% Fage
  * 2 tbsp lowfat sour cream
  * 2 tbsp whole-fat powdered milk
  * 1 tsp &#8220;rum seconds&#8221; vanilla
  * 2 tsp simple syrup

Mix all ingredients together in a bowl. Especially good with fruit.
