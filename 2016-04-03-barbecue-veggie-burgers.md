DB felt these did not require any sauce. That is a veggie burger’s highest honor. It’s worth trying more oat bran and less bread crumbs. I kind of want to add some corn.

  * 2 cans unsalted black beans (365 brand), drained and rinsed
  * ½ cup seasoned bread crumbs (Wegman’s brand)
  * ½ cup oat bran
  * 100g Kerrygold Dubliner cheese, finely chopped (or food processed)
  * ½ Vidalia onion (more might be good), finely chopped or food processed
  * Handful of parsley, finely chopped
  * 4-6 cloves of garlic, smashed
  * A goodly amount of SSS “Carolnia High Country” barbecue seasoning (measure next time)
  * A big squirt of ketchup (best guess ¼ cup—measure and make a note)
  * 2 medium eggs
  * Egg white until the consistency of raw hamburger (see below—measure next time)

Mash the black beans with a fork until somewhat pasty, about halfway broken up. Add everything else—keep adding egg white until the mixture has the consistency of raw hamburger. The mixture should taste pretty good raw—adjust ketchup and barbecue seasoning until it does.

Put on a blazing hot skillet to form a crust, and let sear for a couple of minutes. Repeat on the other side, then turn it way down (medium-low) and let it cook all the way through.
