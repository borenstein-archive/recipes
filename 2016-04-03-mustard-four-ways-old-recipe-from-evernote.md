I only ever make this one way now, with just a bit of honey. But itâ€™s good for reference. Vary however is desired. Pinot grigio is also fine. I think there may be too much liquid here.

  * 8 oz yellow mustard
  * 8 oz brown mustard
  * 2 oz Asian hot mustard
  * 3 cups Dark Horse Chardonnay
  * 3 cups red wine vinegar

Mixed 3 cups of these ingredients with 1 heaping teaspoon of salt.

Mixed 2 cups of these ingredients with 1/2 tsp salt and 1 tbsp honey.

Mixed 1.5 cups of these ingredients with 1 tbsp honey.

Left 1.5 cups as they are.

Let sit for two days, then grind and allow to mature for a week.
