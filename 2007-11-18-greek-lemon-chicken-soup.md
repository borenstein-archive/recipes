This incredibly delicious, beautiful soup requires a bit of practice to make right. The trick is to put in the eggs when the broth is at a high enough temperature to custardize them, but not so high that they would congeal into little bits of egg in the soup. <span style="font-weight: bold;">This recipe is not authentic</span>; &#8220;real&#8221; avgolemono uses boiled chicken instead of sautéed, much less onion, no mushrooms, and is generally much lighter. I like the additional body that the vegetables provide, making this into a dinner éntree proper.

Serve with a salad of bitter greens and vinaigrette.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /> </span>

  * 10 cups chicken broth (preferably fresh)
  * 3 lbs boneless, skinless chicken
  * Olive oil for sautéing
  * 2 eggs
  * 2 yellow onions
  * 12 oz. sliced mushrooms
  * lemon juice (how much? a lot, in my opinion)
  * garlic (ditto)
  * freshly ground black pepper
  * salt to taste
  * cooked rice

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /> </span>

  1. Brown, <span style="font-weight: bold;">but do not cook</span>, the chicken in a bit of olive oil. (i.e., sauté it until the outside turns brown, and then stop.) Set the chicken aside.
  2. In your soup pot, begin sautéing the mushrooms over high heat until they soften.
  3. Add in the onions and sauté until the onions begin to soften.
  4. Add in the garlic and continue to sauté until onion and garlic is golden.
  5. Add in the chicken and broth; bring to a boil.
  6. Once boiling, reduce heat to a simmer and let cook for about 30 minutes or until chicken is very tender.
  7. <span style="font-weight: bold;">While you&#8217;re waiting</span>, beat the eggs thoroughly with the lemon juice.
  8. Once the chicken is cooked, turn down the heat to extremely low. You want the soup to be hot enough to custardize an egg, but not hot enough to fully congeal it.
  9. Take a small amount of the broth and slowly add it into the egg mixture, beating vigorously with a whisk. (This helps to equalize the temperatures.)
 10. Here&#8217;s the scary part: beating as fast as you can, <span style="font-weight: bold;">slowly</span> add the egg mixture to the soup. (It may be easier to remove the chicken first.) The egg will begin to custardize instantly due to the heat of the soup.
 11. Stir in black pepper and salt to taste. Serve with the rice immediately.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">PAIRINGS:</span> Enjoy with an deeply chilled shot of <span style="font-style: italic;">ouzo</span> or <span style="font-style: italic;">sambuca </span>and a cup of hot mint tea.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /> </span>
