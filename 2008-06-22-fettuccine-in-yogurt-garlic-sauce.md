As the weather&#8217;s been getting better, I have been getting back into bicycling. Obsessed, actually. That means carbo-loading the night before a ride and re-loading when I get home. Since it&#8217;s hot, and I&#8217;m tired, I want things that are low-cook or no-cook.

This quickie that I invented last year is one of my favorites for that. It&#8217;s served cold, so it&#8217;s particularly refreshing. A word of warning: raw, fully crushed garlic will cause people to avoid talking to you. (Chewing on a cardamom pod helps, if you can stand it.)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:</span> 

  * 8 oz. (1/2 package) dry whole-wheat fettuccine
  * 1 cup fat-free yogurt
  * 4 medium cloves of garlic, crushed (see previous post)
  * 3 tbsp. ground parmesan cheese
  * 2 tbsp. olive oil
  * 1 tbsp. fresh dill, minced (optional)
  * 1 tbsp. freshly ground black pepper
  * 1 1/2 tsp salt, or to taste

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Cook the fettuccine to taste. Allow to dry thoroughly in a colander or the sauce will not stick.
  2. Combine all other ingredients in medium mixing bowl. Let rest for five minutes to allow flavors to develop.
  3. Toss pasta with sauce; serve chilled.
