I briefly considered calling these &#8220;one pancake to rule them all.&#8221; Seriously, I have only had pancakes this nice from one place before this: [Johnny&#8217;s Luncheonette](http://johnnysluncheonette.com/) in Newton, MA. (Their pancakes have become more variable in quality since the early 2000s.)

These delicate, crepe-like pancakes are out of this world. Thin, soft, just a hint of sourness to balance the sweet, with the caramel notes of the seared exterior&#8211;incredible.

This is basically [this recipe](http://whatscookingamerica.net/Bread/SourdoughPancakes.htm), halved, with a couple of minor modifications. (I mean, olive oil? Seriously?) Also, I took my sourdough starter directly out of the fridge and it was fine. Finally, I used baking powder instead of soda and I think it was better.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 1 cup sourdough starter
  * 1 tbsp. butter, melted
  * 1 tbsp. sugar
  * 1 egg, beaten
  * 1/4 tsp. salt
  * 1/2 tsp. baking powder
  * 2 tsp warm water

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS</span>: 

  1. Combine baking powder and warm water. Set aside.
  2. <span style="font-style: italic;">Gently</span> mix all other ingredients in a small mixing bowl
  3. Add the baking powder mixture and gently combine.
  4. Allow mixture to stand while heating a skillet to medium-high.
  5. Pour about 1/4 cup batter for each pancake. Cook for 60-90 seconds per side. (The pancake is ready to flip the first time when a number of small holes have appeared on the top.)

Serve immediately. Discard leftover batter.
