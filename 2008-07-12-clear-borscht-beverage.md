This is what you do with leftover beet stock.

If you are specifically looking to make clear borscht and therefore just want a lot of beet stock, just shred or grate a number of beets and then boil them in water until they&#8217;re fully cooked. The grating allows more flavor and color to be leeched from the beets.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 2 cups beet stock
  * 1 cup water (or ice if beet stock is warm)
  * 1-2 tbsp. white vinegar, according to taste
  * 1 tbsp. sugar
  * pinch of salt

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:</p> 

<p>
  </span>Shake all ingredients well in a cocktail shaker. Pour into a tall, clear glass. Add a dollop of sour cream if desired.
