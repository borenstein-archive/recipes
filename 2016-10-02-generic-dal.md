Based on [this](http://www.indianasapplepie.com/blogs/indian-as-apple-pie/8792163-dal-pure-and-simple-comfort-in-a-bowl). This is really a side dish unless made in very large quantities.

2 cups red lentils, picked over and washed

  * 6 cups water
  * 1 medium onion, minced
  * 2 cloves garlic
  * 1 1/2 tbsp ginger puree
  * 1 tsp cumin seeds
  * ~3/4 tsp asafetida (didn&#8217;t measure)
  * ~1.5 tbsp butter
  * ~2 tbsp olive oil
  * SSS mild yellow curry (to taste&#8211;didn&#8217;t measure)
  * Mango powder (to taste&#8211;didn&#8217;t measure)
  * Regular salt
  * Kala namak salt

  1. Simmer the lentils, covered, for 20 minutes in the water. Uncover and allow to reduce 15 more minutes on medium heat.
  2. Meanwhile, mince and mash the garlic with kala namak salt.
  3. Make sure that you have bowls with the following positioned close to the stove and ready for use: 
      1. Asafetida and cumin seeds
      2. Onion
      3. Garlic and ginger
  4. In a heavy-bottom frying pan with a lid, heat the oil and the butter until hot. Add the cumin seeds and asafetida and roast until color changes to an orange-ish hue. Stir frequently; cover with lid when not stirring to avoidÂ splatter.
  5. Add the onion and sautee until starting to turn golden.
  6. Add the garlic and the ginger and sautee a bit more.
  7. Add this mixture to the lentils. (It&#8217;s OK if they&#8217;re not done simmering yet.)
  8. Begin by adding 1/2 tsp each of the curry and the mango powder, and 1/4 tsp of salt. Continue to inch your way up on these three flavorings until you like it.
  9. (Optional) continue simmering until desired thickness is achieved. Remember that lentils tend to thicken substantially overnight.
