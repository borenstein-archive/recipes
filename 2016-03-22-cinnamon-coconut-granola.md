_Notes: too dry, not sweet enough, and all oats is probably better. Coconut was barely noticeable. Use larger nuts next time, and instead of coconut, use flaxseed meal._

  * 1 cup rolled oats
  * 2 cups rolled wheat
  * 50g shredded unsweetened coconut
  * 10g flaked almonds
  * 40g walnut pieces
  * 2.5 tbsp sugar
  * ¼ cup olive oil
  * ½ cup egg white
  * 2 tsp homemade vanilla (October batch—single strength, wide cut Madagascar B)
  * Cinnamon (how much?)
  * Salt (how much?)

Toasted the nuts in copper pan. Combined all dry ingredients in a bowl, and all wet ingredients in another bowl. Combined both bowls. Spread onto two baking sheets; baked until crisp, checking every 15 minutes and swapping trays at that time. I think it was about an hour, but I forgot to write it down.
