  * 1 ½  cup oat bran
  * 1 ½  cup rolled oats
  * ¼ cup sugar
  * 1/3 cup olive oil
  * 1 large egg
  * 1/3 cup egg white
  * 1 tbsp vanilla
  * 2 tbsp decaf instant coffee
  * ¼ cup 2% milk powder
  * 2-3 tbsp boiling water (enough to dissolve milk and coffee)
  * ¼ tsp salt

  1. Preheat oven to 250F.
  2. Combine the coffee, boiling water and milk powder and stir vigorously until dissolved. You will get a smooth paste reminiscent of melted chocolate. Combine this paste and the egg, egg white, and oil and beat thoroughly until well mixed. The egg will emulsify the oil and the water. Add the sugar, salt and vanilla and beat thoroughly. Set aside.
  3. Combine the oat bran and rolled oats in a large bowl. Pour the coffee-egg mixture over the oat mixture.  Mix thoroughly with a spatula. Line a jelly roll pan with parchment paper. Spread the raw granola over this parchment paper. Bake for about an hour, until a little less crunchy than desired, stirring every 20 minutes. Allow to cool before transferring to jar.
