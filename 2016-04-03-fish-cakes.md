_Super cheap, easy and healthy. Too bad it’s not vegetarian. Mackerel is considered a sustainable fishery, and it’s super high in omegas. Since it’s low on the food chain, it shouldn’t have a lot of heavy metals._

  * 1 can bumble bee mackerel, drained
  * ½ cup oat bran
  * ½ cup no salt added canned sweet corn
  * ½ cup egg white
  * ¼ cup lowfat sour
  * A bunch of mustard and some Texas Pete’s hot sauce

Mix everything up in a bowl. It will look, feel, and smell gross—ignore it. Heat a nonstick griddle to medium and spray with canola oil. Form patties. They will be loose, so place them carefully on the griddle. Cook them four minutes per side or so, covered, flipping carefully. They will be much firmer after they cook. Delicious and 180 calories each, not to mention about 75 cents apiece.
