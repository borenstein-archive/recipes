  * 2 packages (12 oz. each) Ray’s wheat meat
  * 1.5 lbs crimini mushrooms, scrubbed, trimmed and quartered
  * 2 tbsp butter
  * 1 tsp asafetida
  * 2 tbsp flour
  * 1/2 cup water

Cut wheat meat into 1.5” cubes, reserving liquid. Melt butter in wide saucepan over medium-high heat. Add asafetida and allow to dissolve, stirring constantly. Add mushrooms and toss to coat. Add water and cover pot. Turn heat to high.

Once the pot reaches a boil, uncover and allow to cook at high heat, stirring occasionally, until most of the water is gone. Add the seitan, toss, and allow to come back to a simmer.

Toss once more, then add reserved liquid from wheat meat. Toss to coat. Add flour gradually, tossing constantly to coat evenly. Allow to cook for 1-2 minutes more. Serve immediately.
