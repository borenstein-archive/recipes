I had a craving for a chili with a cocoa base, and this hit the spot. It reminded me of cochinita pibil, although it has little in common with it&#8211;hence the name. 

<div>
</div>

<div>
  1 1/4 lb &#8220;German&#8221; sausage from Whole Foods (prefer Andouille if available)
</div>

<div>
  1 lb fresh tomatoes
</div>

<div>
  1 ripe red bell pepper
</div>

<div>
  1 large Spanish onion, chopped
</div>

<div>
  1 head garlic, crushed
</div>

<div>
  ~10 oz dried small red beans, cooked to medium tenderness
</div>

<div>
  ~3/4 cup frozen sweet corn kernels
</div>

<div>
  1 tbsp. cocoa
</div>

<div>
  1 tbsp. paprika
</div>

<div>
  Cinnamon (by eyeball&#8211;probably <1 tsp)
</div>

<div>
  Cumin (by eyeball&#8211;about 1/2 as much as cinnamon)
</div>

<div>
  Olive oil for saute
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  What I actually did:
</div>

<div>
</div>

<div>
  1. Shred tomatoes and pepper using a hand grater or food processor.
</div>

<div>
  2. Heat a heavy iron stew pot to med-high.
</div>

<div>
  3. Uncase sausage into pot, and put casings in. Add spices and cocoa; sear. Remove from pot and set aside.
</div>

<div>
  4. Put in olive oil and let heat briefly. Add onions and garlic. Spices had stuck to bottom, so scraped to deglaze with water that onions were casting off. This was a little dicey.
</div>

<div>
  5. When onions were moderately well-cooked, put in tomatoes, pepper, meat mixture and all remaining ingredients. Brought to a simmer, reduced to low and let cook, covered, for 10 minutes.
</div>

  I served this with shredded cabbage, quinoa and Louisiana Hot Sauce. It was excellent. I&#8217;d probably put the spices when the onions were almost finished, so that they could still dry-cook a little bit but not cake onto the bottom of the pan. The corn looked distracting but the added sweetness was pleasant. Perhaps grated carrots could serve the same purpose. I wish I could have made the whole thing a deeper hue of reddish brown.
