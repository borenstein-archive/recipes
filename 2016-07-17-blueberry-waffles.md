These worked reasonably well. The batter continued to thicken up over about 10 minutes, at the end of which they were much better; the later waffles were much easier to remove from the iron, and had a much more satisfying texture. So the best strategy is probably to move the batter to a bowl and then let it sit for 10 minutes before putting in the waffle iron.

Nutritional stats are solid: 350 cal, 18g protein(18% of cals), 9g fat (20% of cals) per 1 cup serving; 62g carbs (62% of cals), of which 10 are from fiber and 17 are from sugars.

It might be worth trying to replace some of the white flour with more egg white protein and psyllium.

  * 200g white flour
  * 200g oat bran
  * 40g Jarrow whey protein
  * 4 tbsp whole milk powder
  * 1/4 cup egg white protein
  * 1 tbsp baking powder
  * Scant 1/2 tsp salt
  * 1 kg blueberries
  * 1 overripe banana (~120g)
  * 180g fage (what I had)
  * 3 tbsp butter
  * 30g molasses
  * 5 drops stevia
  * 1 1/2 tbsp homemade vanilla (MadB first extraction)
  * 3/4 tsp Saigon cinnamon
  * 2 tbsp psyllium
