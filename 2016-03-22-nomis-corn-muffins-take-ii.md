These were very good. They were a bit mushy on the inside and a bit too dry on the outside—try reducing heat and cooking until dry when poked. Also, try putting half the corn in the food processor instead of a dash. The WF no-salt corn looked and tasted much better—use only that, and adjust salt accordingly.

  * ½ cup flour
  * 1/3 cup cornmeal
  * 3 tbsp sugar
  * 2 tsp baking powder
  * ¼ tsp salt
  * 2/3 cup (ish) lowfat sour cream
  * ½ cup lowfat cottage cheese
  * 3 tbsp butter
  * 1 tbsp milk powder
  * 1 tbsp buttermilk powder
  * 1 egg
  * 1 can no-salt-added sweet corn, drained
  * 1 can (15 oz) “bread and butter” corn, drained

Preheated oven to 350F. Mixed the two corn types together in a colander as I drained. Combined all but the corn in the food processor and ground until smooth. Added a handful of the corn to the food processor and pulsed until partially broken up (like creamed corn). Combined everything in a bowl. Spread into an oiled muffin tin. Baked at 350 for about an hour until dry when poked.
