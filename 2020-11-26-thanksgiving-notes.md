Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, our family had to make Thanksgiving all for ourselves this year. We took it as an opportunity to develop our own menu, as well as our own format: not one massive meal, but three reasonably sized ones with more dishes becoming available throughout the day.

Breakfast:
- [Nomi's corn muffins](2016-03-22-nomis-corn-muffins-take-ii.md)
- [Formless jello mold](2016-04-03-chia-seed-jello-mold.md)

Lunch *additions*:
- [Caulichowder](2020-11-26-caulichowder.md)
- ["The Pardon" by No Evil](https://www.noevilfoods.com/products/the-pardon/) prepared [as discussed here](2020-11-26-no-evil-the-pardon.md)
- [Mushroom gravy](2020-11-26-mushroom-gravy.md)

Dinner *additions*:
- [Mom's lakshen (noodle) kugel](2020-11-26-lakshen-kugel.md)
- Pecan pie from Able Baker (we thought it was too sweet)

The Pardon with the gravy tasted just like stuffing. With the formless jello mold, it was pretty much a spot on traditional Thanksgiving experience. All in all, we were very happy with how it shook out, which is why I'm making these notes.
