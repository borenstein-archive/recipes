This is something that we make all the time in cold months. After going awhile without making it, we sometimes forget the proportions.

  * 0.5 cup water
  * 0.5 cup 2% milk
  * 0.5 cup egg white
  * 0.5 cup oat bran

Heat the water and the milk over med-high heat until scalded. Reduce heat to low. Add the oat bran, stir once to combine, then add the egg white and increase heat to medium, stirring frequently until partially set (1-3 minutes). Turn off heat and allow to stand for a couple minutes more before serving.
