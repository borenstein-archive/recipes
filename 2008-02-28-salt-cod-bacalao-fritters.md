These delicious fritters came from Rafael Pereira&#8217;s &#8220;Spanish Tapas&#8221; class at the Cambridge Center for Adult Education. His classes are highly recommended; I plan on taking more of them.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">UPDATE 3/29/2008: </span>I attempted to make these by sautéing instead of frying. Unfortunately, I found the fritters had the tendency to fall apart. I compensated by adding additional flour; this held them together but this created a &#8216;flour pancake&#8217; taste that seemed ill-suited to the dish. I am going to experiment with corn-based strategies (corn flour? corn meal?) after Passover.

Rafael served them with an apple aioli; I plan on coming up with my own sweet aioli (perhaps a honey aioli?) before I post one here.

INGREDIENTS:

* 1/2 lb. salt cod    
* 3 medium potatoes, boiled and mashed    
* 2 tbsp. flat-leaf parsley or cilantro, minced    
* 1 medium onion, minced    
* 1 egg, lightly beaten    
* 1/4 cup flour    
* 2 tbsp. olive oil    
* Salt and pepper to taste    
* Oil for frying

DIRECTIONS:

1. Soak the salt cod for 8-12 hours in cold water, changing the water 3 times. Pat dry and mince.   
2. Heat the olive oil in a medium high skillet, then sauté the onions for 1 minute. Add the salt cod, cilantro, salt and pepper; sauté for 3-5 minutes.   
3. Add the mixture to the mashed potatoes. Gradually add the egg and the flour.   
4. Refrigerate the mixture for one hour.   
5. Heat vegetable oil for frying. Once hot, add heaping tablespoons to it, removing them after they have turned golden brown.

Serve immediately with aioli and Spanish red wine.
