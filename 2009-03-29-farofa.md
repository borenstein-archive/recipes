This weekend, I made a full <span style="font-style: italic;">feijoada</span> dinner. This is apparently a big deal kind of thing in Brazil, where it&#8217;s got all kinds of fixins.

One of those fixins is <span style="font-style: italic;">farofa</span>, or pan-roasted cassava flour. I had this for the first time with a friend at the excellent [Muqueca restaurant](http://www.muquecarestaurant.com/) in Cambridge. At the time, my reaction could basically be summarized as &#8216;wtf&#8217;? What are you supposed to do with a pile of roasted flour?

The answer: If you try mix it in with a soupy bean stew, it takes on the consistency of Thanksgiving stuffing, but with all that great savory flavor. Don&#8217;t miss it.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note: </span>In all of the following recipes, I make copious use of salt pork. Savegnor&#8217;s (on Kirkland St, near Dali restaurant) makes their own &#8220;lean&#8221; salt pork, which is basically salt-cured bacon. Whole Foods sells a Niemann Ranch variety, which is much fattier. If you&#8217;re interested in cutting down on cholesterol a bit, you could go with equal amounts olive oil.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 3 oz salt pork, minced
  * 500g (about 3 cups) cassava flour (also called yucca flour or manioc)
  * 1 large Spanish onion, diced
  * 1/2 cup chopped parsley
  * 1 tsp. sugar

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. In a deep skillet, heat the salt pork over a medium flame until it begins to cast off some grease.
  2. Add the onion and sugar; sauté with the salt pork, stirring frequently, until the onions turn translucent.
  3. Add the parsley and continue to sauté until the onions turn golden.
  4. Add the cassava flour a little at a time, turning constantly. Make sure none sticks to the bottom of the pan.
  5. Keep turning the mixture in the pan until the cassava begins to turn golden beige. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The mixture is extremely hot in the pan; use caution if tasting!<br /></span>

Keep dry until serving.
