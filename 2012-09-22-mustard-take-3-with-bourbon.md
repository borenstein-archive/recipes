I had a few drops of bourbon left (just over 2 tbsp) after my third batch of baked beans, so I used it in a half-batch of mustard. This time, I used 6 oz of Element Red Giant ale, of which I&#8217;d picked up a growler on my way back from MA to Princeton. 50/50 yellow and brown, 3 minute grind. This time, it came out so good that I considered eating it straight from the food processor instead of putting it in a jar. &nbsp;I know, disgusting. But it&#8217;s that good.

Note: the whole time, I&#8217;ve been using 1/2 tsp allspice and no cloves, because it turns out the bag of bulk &#8220;cloves&#8221; that I had was really bulk allspice. Oh well, apparently 1/2 tsp allspice and no cloves is just fine.
