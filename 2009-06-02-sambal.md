Sambal is a sweet and intensely sour garlic sauce that originates in southeast Asia. I was first introduced to the sauce in Emilie Hardman&#8217;s eye-opening &#8220;Creative Vegan Cooking&#8221; class at Cambridge Center for Adult Education. To turn this sauce back to a vegan item, substitute nori and salt for the fish sauce.

Green jalapeños result in a brilliant burgundy sauce. Red ones produce a color similar to chiles in adobo. 2 jalapeños seems fairly temperate; I&#8217;d recommend more (or stronger) peppers for the spice-inclined.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:</span> 

  * 6 shallots, peeled
  * 3 jalapeños, trimmed of stems
  * 6 cloves garlic, crushed
  * 2 tbsp. concentrated tamarind paste
  * 2 tbsp. sugar
  * 1 tbsp. sesame oil
  * 1 tbsp. olive oil
  * 2 tbsp. fish sauce (or half a tin of anchovies)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:</span> 

  1. Combine all ingredients in a food processor; process for at least one minute or until smooth.
  2. Transfer sauce to a deep skillet and cook over medium-high heat until simmering.
