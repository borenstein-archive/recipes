_Smoking the tomatillos was probably more work than is justified. Although the smoke was certainly apparent, it just didn’t improve the dish enough to justify the significant effort involved. This dish can be simplified significantly. The canned beans were because the original beans didn’t come out well, and they were fine. This went really well in long rolls as a sort of “chili dog.”_

  * 1 lb tomatillos
  * Olive oil, mixed use
  * Handful of cilantro, minced fine
  * 3 garlic cloves, smashed
  * Lemon juice (how much?)
  * 18 oz quorn crumbles
  * 3 cans of beans, mixed varieties, drained
  * Asafetida
  * 2 large Spanish onions
  * Salt
  * Italian green sweet pepper (or a spicier variety)
  * ½ tsp cumin

  1. Presoak two handfuls of hickory wood chips. Light a chimney of charcoal briquettes (which burn much longer and more evenly than lump charcoal.) Boil a kettle of water, and set up a drip with the water in it on one side of a grill. On the other side, pour in the coals.
  2. Cut the tomatillos in half. Put a bit of olive oil in the bottom of a 12” cast iron pan, and arrange the tomatillos in the pan, cut side down.
  3. Put the drained wood chips over the coals, and replace grill rack. Put the cast iron pan over the grill rack. Cover, adjust heat to 350, and let cook for at least two hours. The tomatillos will caramelize like fire roasted tomatoes, with a strong smoke flavor. You could also grill the pepper, although I forgot.
  4. Put olive oil, sufficient for shallow frying, in a wide pot. Heat to near smoke point. Add asafetida and allow to dissolve. Sautee onions until golden. Add quorn and cook as with beef.
  5. If you didn’t grill the pepper: turn your hottest burner to high. Place the pepper on the burner. Allow to roast over open flame for about 1 minute to a side, turning with tongs. Chop somewhat fine, throwing away seeds.
  6. Grind the cilantro, garlic, cumin and some salt in a mortar and pestle.
  7. Grind the tomatillos, cilantro mixture, lemon juice, and roasted pepper in the food processor. Don’t overdo it—you want this to stay somewhat coarse.
  8. Combine everything in the pot with the onions and quorn, and allow to get hot over medium flame, stirring occasionally.
