I woke up this morning hankering for some pancakes, but out of eggs. So I googled &#8216;eggless pancakes,&#8217; found [this](http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,165,133179-255194,00.html), and crunchified it. Note that these cook pretty fast and don&#8217;t really give visual cues of when to flip them, so be attentive.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 1 cup white flour
  * 1 cup milk
  * 1/4 cup walnut pieces
  * 2 tbsp. butter, melted
  * 2 tbsp. dark molasses
  * 1 tbsp. light brown sugar
  * 1 tbsp. water
  * 2 tsp. baking powder
  * 1 tsp. cinnamon
  * 1 tsp. vanilla
  * 1/4 tsp. salt

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Combine all dry ingredients in a medium mixing bowl.
  2. Stir in remaining ingredients. Let sit for 5 minutes.
  3. Preheat a nonstick or cast-iron skillet to medium heat.
  4. Pour 2 tbsp. batter onto the skillet for each pancake.
  5. Turn over after about 45 seconds; turn again; serve immediately.
