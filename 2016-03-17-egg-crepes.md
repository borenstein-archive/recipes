_We have been trying to reconstruct what I did spontaneously that very first time. Here are our attempts so far._

**Ingredients for two people:**

  * 5 eggs
  * 2 tbsp Greek yogurt
  * strong concentrated milk mixture
  * 2 shakes salt
  * 1/2 tsp sugar
  * 1/2 tsp baking powder
  * 1 capful good vanilla

**Directions:**

  1. Whisk thoroughly, cook in two batches over HOT buttered peter pan

&nbsp;

**Old Notes:**

Unfortunately, the exact method from the first try is lost, but I think the key was (1) egg whites, (2) Greek yogurt and (3) milk powder.

The pan needs to be well-seasoned so that the crepe can come off easily. I imagine that I used the 10” cast iron skillet, but maybe not, given that I can’t really pick that up and I think I got the whole thing to cook.

Beyond that, these things help:

Sugar (a little bit)

Vanilla

Heather had vanilla walnut bourbon

David had nutmeg

Cinnamon

Some options: Fill with jam and top with strawberries; Fill with Nutella and top with bananas
