This was very good, and we used it to stuff Portobello caps for a grand total of mushrooms four ways. Could use all creminis, all oysters, whatever. The ketchup, tamarind and molasses were used in place of Worcestershire sauce. I didn’t miss the anchovy paste used in WS because the mushrooms provided all the _umami_ I needed.

  * ¼ cup dried porcini mushrooms
  * 1 lb cremini mushrooms, cleaned and quartered
  * 1/3 lb oyster mushrooms, cut into ¾” strips
  * 1 ½  cups cooked quinoa
  * ½ cup grated parmesan
  * ~1 tsp asafetida
  * 2 tbsp olive oil
  * 1 package (12 oz) quorn grounds
  * 1 medium-large Vidalia onion
  * 2-3 tsp SS tamarind concentrate
  * 2-3 tbsp ketchup
  * ~1 tsp molasses
  * Coarse salt to taste
  * Handful of parsley, minced

Boil enough water to cover the porcinis. Pour water over porcinis and set aside.

Heat the olive oil in a wide saucepan. Add the asafetida and let it dissolve. Add the onions and the cremini and oyster mushrooms. Add some salt, which will help pull out the liquid. Sautee until partially caramelized. When  the porcinis have soaked for about 5-10 minutes, take them out of the soaking liquid (set aside), cut up into small pieces, and add to the sauté.

Add the quorn to the sautee and let cook thoroughly. Add more salt.

When close to done, add the ketchup, molasses and tamarind and stir to combine. Deglaze with porcini soaking liquid and stir.

Turn off heat and all remaining ingredients; stir thoroughly. Makes about 6 cups.
