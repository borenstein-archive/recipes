I went into a local Portuguese grocery to find <span style="font-style: italic;">carne seca<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></span>, a spicy Brazilian dried beef product. There was a Brazilian woman talking to the cashier. I asked the cashier if she had it. She looked at me quizzically. The Brazilian woman, however, began to wax poetic.

&#8220;Ah, carne seca! Feijoada! com presunto. e cebola. e farofa. e caipirinha&#8230;ah, boy.&#8221;

&#8220;I think you need to go to a Brazilian store,&#8221; said the cashier.

This recipe is the result of a good deal of research, and draws principally on [the feijoada completa recipe on this page](http://www.brazzil.com/p24nov96.htm) and [this recipe](http://www.maria-brazil.org/feijoada.htm). The salt pork provides all the salt you need.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 1 lb black beans, soaked overnight and drained
  * 1 lb. ham, cut into 3/4&#8243; pieces
  * 1 lb. linguica (see below)
  * 1/2 lb flanken or other stew beef (see below)
  * 2 spanish onions, diced
  * 4 cloves of garlic, crushed
  * 4 oz. salt pork, finely minced (divided use)
  * 2 oz. <span style="font-style: italic;">carne seca <span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></span>or plain beef jerky, soaked overnight
  * 2 bay leaves
  * 1/2 tsp. sugar
  * Zest of one orange

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:</span> 

  1. Prick the linguica several times with a fork. Simmer in water for about 10 minutes, then cut into 3/4&#8243; pieces.
  2. Drain and mince the soaked carne seca.
  3. Tenderize the stew beef by pounding it with a tenderizer or kitchen mallet, then cut into 3/4&#8243; pieces.
  4. Heat 3 oz of salt pork in a heavy stew pot over medium heat until it begins to cast off grease. Turn heat to high and add the flanken. Sear on all sides for about 30 seconds per side.
  5. Add the beans, bay leaves, zest and all of the meat to the pot. Add enough water to cover by one to two inches. (You can add or remove some later.)
  6. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, covered, for 90 minutes. Add more water if needed.
  7. In a nonstick frying pan, heat the remaining salt pork on medium heat until it begins to cast off grease. Saut√© the onions and garlic with the sugar until they begin to turn golden.
  8. To the onion mixture, add 2 cups of beans from the stew. Mash well and allow to cook together for 3-5 minutes.
  9. Stir this mixture back into the stew; cook for another 30 minutes.

Serve with farofa and fresh orange slices. Pair with a tart cocktail such as <span style="font-style: italic;">caipirinha.</span>
