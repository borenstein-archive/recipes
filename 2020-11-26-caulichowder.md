# Caulichowder

Very rough notes. 

- Cooked two heads of cauliflower in a small amount of water using an instant pot. (Broke into florets, cooked for 2 minutes high pressure, quick release.)
- Fried a medium red onion, oarsley chopped, in olive oil. Probably could have done with more onions. Probably could have benefitted from asafoetida.
- Blended cauliflower, onions, a log of goat cheese, some cheddar, and some parmesan in Vitamix.
- Steamed 3 lbs of yellow potatoes, diced to 1/2" cubes, in instant pot. 4 minutes, quick release. Not done enough. This was also WAY too many potatoes.
- Mixed potatoes into blended cauliflower base. Added salt, white pepper, garlic powder, onion powder to taste.

It  has some things in common with mashed potatoes, which helped in bringing about the very traditional (Turkey-based) feel and taste of our vegetarian meal.

Given the large number of potatoes, mixing in chopped "The Pardon" seitan roast gave it a quality very similar to a New England-style chowder, which was a nice use of leftovers.
