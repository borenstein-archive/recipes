I had this nailed the last time. Unfortunately, the recipe didn’t get saved. I will attempt to get it again. This is based on Mark Bittman’s recipe from “How To Cook Everything Vegetarian,” pps 518-519. He used way too little fresh mushrooms and white wine, so I fixed that. This is also a double recipe.

I got the consistency better the first time than the second. This is a difficult recipe and it requires practice.

  * 1.5 cup dried porcini mushrooms
  * 8 cups vegetable stock
  * 1 ½  cups dry white wine
  * ½ cup olive oil, divided use
  * 4 tbsp butter
  * 500g Vidalia onions, diced
  * 2 lbs crimini mushrooms, sliced thin
  * 3 cups Arborio rice
  * 1/8 + a pinch  tsp saffron (I used Mehr [Iran]), divided use
  * ¼ tsp asafetida

  1. Pour stock over porcinis to cover. Heat in microwave and set aside, covered. Heat remaining stock in a pot with the saffron. In a separate pot, put some of the butter. Put in the diced onions in and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the rice and cook until gleaming. It’s good if some of the rice turns a little toasty, but don’t actually burn it.
  2. Around this time, heat up the olive oil and the rest of the butter in a separate pan.  Add the fresh mushrooms and cook until sautéed. This will take a long time, during which you can make the risotto. When the mushrooms throw off a lot of water, add a pinch of saffron.
  3. Back to the rice. Add the wine, about 1/3 cup at a time, with the heat on medium. Don’t add more until the last splash is largely cooked away. Take the porcinis out of their soaking liquid and add the soaking liquid the same way. Finally, continue with the saffron broth. It’s so important to keep stirring, and to make sure it never gets soupy. Don’t rush this process!
  4. When you have a moment between pours, chop up the porcinis pretty fine and throw them in the pot. Finally, when the texture is basically where you want it (al dente, but cooked through), add the criminis and stir thoroughly. Now add parmesan to taste. If you want really a ton of parmesan, it’s a good idea to combine high-quality parmesan with lower quality parmesan: even with porcinis and saffron, the parmesan is the most expensive part.
