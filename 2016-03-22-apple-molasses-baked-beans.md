<u></u>_Figuring out equivalence for sugar levels: table sugar is pure sucrose, so 1g table sugar = 1g dietary sugar.  Brown sugar is nearly pure sugar—220g of brown sugar has 213g of dietary sugar. 1 cup of apple cider has 27g of sugar. So for 130g sugar, you’d want the equivalent of 4.8 cups of cider. The “6x” cider is actually 6.4x, so I need 0.75 cups of that._** **

These came out very sophisticated. I think they need some added sugar in addition to the cider molasses. They only need 1 tsp asafetida.

  * 1 lb navy beans*
  * 550g Vidalia onions
  * 5 cloves garlic
  * 2 tsp high grade asafetida (yellow 3.5 oz canister, from India)
  * ¼ cup olive oil
  * 55g blackstrap molasses
  * ¾ cup 6x cider molasses
  * 70g WF organic ketchup
  * 30g fancy local ketchup (I was running out of WF)
  * 1 tsp Cedarhouse liquid hickory smoke
  * 1 heaping tsp paprika
  * 9g kala namak
  * 1 tbsp Bourbon Barrel Foods vegan Worcestershire sauce
  * 1 cup bean cooking liquid
  * 1 cup water
  * 1 cup Heaven Hill bourbon
  * 60g mustard (some homemade, some Grey Poupon)
  * 4 tbsp cider vinegar

* I once again overcooked the first batch of soaked beans, then made another batch of unsoaked beans in the cooking liquid of the first batch. I should just do unsoaked every time.

Procedure as usual.
