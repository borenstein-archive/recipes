I invented this stew for my mother&#8217;s birthday when I was an undergraduate. Since then, I have made a few variations on it: one involving tender cactus, another involving mixed beans. This time I decided to use potatoes and green tomatoes; I think it worked very nicely.

One thing to note is that it&#8217;s very, very easy to heat the lamb too hot while stewing; if you do, it will end up tough. Bringing to a boil is the kiss of death. I haven&#8217;t gotten this exactly right in quite a long time; if anyone has a trick, please do share.

This dish seems far and away best suited to the spring, when the early-season tomatoes are still green. But a close second is fall&#8211;cold enough at night to justify a soul-warming stew, but warm enough during the day that a cilantro-and-lemon combination would still be welcome.

An awful lot of chopping needs to go into this stew. Indeed, by the end, I broke down and used a mini-prep to prepare the herbs and the hot pepper.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS<br /></span> 

  * 1 1/2 lbs green tomatoes, diced into 1/2&#8243; cubes
  * 1 lb fresh tomatillos, husked and diced into 1/2&#8243; cubes
  * 1 1/2 lbs Russet potatoes, peeled and diced into 3/4&#8243; cubes
  * 1 1/2 lbs lamb, cut into small pieces
  * 1/3 cup cilantro, finely minced
  * 1 bunch scallions, finely minced
  * 1 Annaheim pepper (or other chili), minced
  * 4 cloves garlic, [crushed](http://tofuvavohu.blogspot.com/2008/06/how-to-crush-garlic.html)
  * 1 large yellow onion, diced
  * 6 cups [chicken broth](http://tofuvavohu.blogspot.com/2008/02/chicken-broth.html)
  * 1/4 cup lemon juice
  * Olive oil
  * Salt to taste

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. In a large soup pot, heat 2 tbsp. olive oil over medium-high heat. Add lamb and brown on all sides, about 2-3 minutes per side.
  2. Remove lamb and set aside. Add more olive oil if necessary; reduce heat to medium-low. Sauté onions and garlic, stirring constantly until beginning to turn golden, about 5-6 minutes.
  3. Add the minced pepper and sauté for 2 minutes more.
  4. Add the tomatoes, tomatillos, lemon juice and herbs; increase the heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
  5. Add all remaining ingredients. Bring to a just under a simmer, then reduce heat to very low (just below a simmer) and let cook, covered, for 1 hour.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE: <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span></span>if your stew should accidentally reach a boil, quickly shut off heat and uncover. You may find that the lamb is already cooked through (it will cook through after only a couple of minutes at a boil); in that case, shut off the heat and allow to rest, covered, for another 30 minutes. This will tenderize the lamb somewhat.

Serve with a slice of avocado. Makes excellent leftovers.
