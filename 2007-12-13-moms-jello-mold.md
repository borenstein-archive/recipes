I am only slightly embarrassed to put a Jello mold on this blog. But one of its main functions is to catalog the foods that my family and I care about, so <span style="font-style: italic;">haute cuisine </span>be damned: this Jello mold has been showing up at family functions since my grandmother came up with it long before I was thinking about being born.

Anyways, I think it&#8217;s pretty and I like it better than cranberry sauce to have with my turkey. It&#8217;s dark red, it&#8217;s tangy, it&#8217;s got texture. It&#8217;s very 1950s. You can imagine some people getting back from the Catskills and trying to decide what to serve their neighbors for dinner:

&#8220;What do you think of liver and onions, Candice?&#8221;  
&#8220;Well, Fred, we served it to the Horowitzes the last time they were here. How about some nice <span style="font-style: italic;">kishkas?&#8221;<br /></span>&#8220;<span style="font-style: italic;">Kishkas</span>! But I&#8230;&#8221;  
&#8220;&#8216;But I&#8217; what? Nu? Solomon, you hear your father? Complaining about Kishkas? Tell him&#8211;&#8220;  
&#8220;Alright, Candice, Alright. But only if you make that Jello mold with the plums.&#8221;<span style="font-style: italic;"><br /></span>  
So&#8230;anyways:

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 2 6oz. packages berry (cranberry, raspberry, strawberry, etc.) Jello
  * 2 cups walnuts, coarsely chopped
  * 2 cups seedless tangerines or oranges, cut into pieces
  * 2 large golden delicious apples, sliced and diced
  * 1 grated orange peel
  * 2 (15 oz.) cans whole cranberry sauce
  * 1 can purple plums, pitted and chopped
  * Non-stick cooking spray

<span style="font-weight: bold;">RECIPE:<br /></span> 

  1. Boil 2 cups of water and put in a large bowl.
  2. Dissolve Jello in the water, stirring constantly to prevent lumps.
  3. Add 2 cups of cold water and grated orange rind.
  4. Refrigerate until &#8220;jiggly&#8221;: 30-60 minutes.
  5. Break up the cranberry sauce and add the fruit and nuts to the Jello.
  6. Spray an 8-10 cup mold with cooking spray and pour in the Jello mixture.
  7. Refrigerate until the Jello is set.

Solomon, Candice, Fred and the Horowitzes will all be pleased, I&#8217;m sure.
