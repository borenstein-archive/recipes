Don&#8217;t be fooled: the only similarity this has with the recipe below is the basic ingredients. Aside from that, it has much more in common with hummus: the flavor, the heartiness, the incredible ease of making it. The walnuts play a similar role to tahini, but of course have a very different flavor. With much more texture than hummus, this is also more of a salad than a dip. Served with an eggplant course, it would also make a good vegan or vegetarian dinner.

(This recipe is based on a similar recipe called &#8220;Red Beans with Walnut Sauce&#8221; from the Russian cookbook <span style="font-style: italic;">Please to the Table.)</p> 

<p>
  </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      1 lb. dry red beans
    </li>
    <li>
      8 oz. walnuts, chopped
    </li>
    <li>
      1 medium red onion, finely chopped
    </li>
    <li>
      1/3 cup balsamic vinegar
    </li>
    <li>
      2 tbsp. olive oil
    </li>
    <li>
      1 tbsp chopped garlic
    </li>
    <li>
      1/2 tsp ground coriander seeds
    </li>
    <li>
      Salt and pepper to taste
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:</span> 
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rinse and cook the beans. You can either do this the conventional way (soak overnight, boil for 2 hours, let sit for an hour) or the lazy way: throw them in a slow cooker with 3 quarts of water and let it cook on low for 8-12 hours. Drain the beans and put in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mash the beans slightly, then mix in all other ingredients.
      </li>
    </ol>
