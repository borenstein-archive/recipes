This pie is unreasonably delicious, and extremely easy to make. Leave the pie crust frozen until you are ready to use it.

My mother got it from some cookbook and I inherited a xerox of a xerox. Whoever the original author is, my apologies for failing to provide an attribution. (Also, the original author will note that I&#8217;ve changed a couple of things, which of course means they must be improvements.)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS</span> 

  * 1/2 cup sugar
  * 1/3 cup light brown sugar
  * 1/3 cup light corn syrup
  * 2 tbsp. unsalted butter, melted
  * 1 tsp vanilla extract
  * 3 medium eggs
  * 3/4 cup raw shredded coconut
  * 3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips
  * 1 cup whole pecans
  * 9&#8243; frozen deep-dish pie crust

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:</span>

  1. Put a baking sheet in the oven and preheat to 350 F. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The baking sheet</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">is important! Without it, the inside of your pie won&#8217;t cook properly.</span>
  2. Mix sugar, brown sugar, corn syrup, butter and vanilla in a mixing bowl. You will get a big, sugary blob, which is cool.
  3. Beat eggs and mix them into the aforementioned blob of sugar.
  4. Add coconut, pecans and chocolate.
  5. Pour all of this into the frozen pie crust.
  6. Shove the whole thing in the oven and leave it there for 50 minutes or until the top is brown and the inside is more or less set. (The recipe originally said 40 minutes, but I&#8217;ve found that it takes significantly longer than that.)
  7. Remove from oven, cover in foil, let cool slightly. The inside will firm up a bit as the chocolate solidifies.
  8. Serve warm.
