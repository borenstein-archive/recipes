Unfortunately, I didn’t measure any proportions for these. But they came out stunning.

  * Black beans (I used dried, cooked in PC—about 1 large can’s worth)
  * Panko bread crumbs
  * Sharp orange cheddar (first batch was actually Mimolette)
  * ¾ of a red onion, minced
  * Ketchup
  * Homemade Dijon mustard
  * Molasses
  * A drop of egg white

Put black beans in a bowl and mash somewhat with the back of a fork. Stir in about 1/3 as much panko as you had black beans. Add onion. Add ketchup to desired sweetness, then add molasses until it has a barbecue sauce flavor. Add mustard to desired zip. Add just a small amount of egg white—a couple of tbsp, if even—so that the mixture is moistened and easier to stir, but still pretty firm and stiff. Form into patties and cook.
