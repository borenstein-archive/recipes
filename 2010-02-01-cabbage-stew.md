<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:</span> 

  * 2 lbs green cabbage, finely shredded (about 1 medium head)
  * 2 medium sweet onions, thinly sliced
  * Oil for sauté
  * Dried mushrooms (any kind)
  * 6-8 cups chicken broth
  * 1 cup white wine (if available)
  * 4 medium yellow potatoes, peeled and cut into 3/4&#8243; cubes
  * 1 lb pork kielbasa, sliced on a bias
  * 1-3 tsp red pepper flakes (to taste)
  * Salt to taste

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Cover the mushrooms with boiling water. Let stand for ten minutes. Set aside, reserving the liquid. (You may want to strain it.)
  2. In a heavy skillet, brown the kielbasa slices over high heat. Set aside.
  3. Reduce heat to medium low and sauté the onions until partially caramelized. Set aside.
  4. Add more oil if needed. Add the cabbage to the pan and cover for 30 seconds to wilt; repeat until it has reduced in volume by about 50%. Sauté the cabbage until partially caramelized.
  5. Deglaze the pan with the wine, if using, or broth, and transfer to a soup pot.
  6. Combine all ingredients in the soup pot and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and let cook, covered, for 30 minutes or until potatoes are cooked through.

Serve with sour cream and black pepper. Pairs well with bitter greens.
