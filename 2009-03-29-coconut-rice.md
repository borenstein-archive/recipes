This is easy and nice; it goes well with many warm-weather foods.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 2 cups jasmine rice
  * 3 cups water
  * 2 oz. shredded, unsweetened coconut
  * 2 bay leaves

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Rinse and prepare the rice according to the directions on the package, adding bay leaves before cooking.
  2. Meanwhile, put the coconut in a skillet. Roast on medium-low heat, turning constantly, until it begins to turn golden-orange.
  3. The instant the coconut is golden-orange, remove it from the heat and set aside until the rice is done.
  4. Remove the bay leaves from the rice; stir in the coconut. Serve immediately.
