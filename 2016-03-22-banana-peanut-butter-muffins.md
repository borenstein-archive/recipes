The big, sweet chocolate chips were kind of jarring. Try melted unsweetened chocolate and some cocoa powder. The texture on the crust wasn&#8217;t as crisp as DB would prefer, giving off a distinct health food effect. Consider slightly increasing wheat flour and slightly decreasing bran. Also consider adding more egg white to increase fluffiness.

100g oat bran

400g bananas

85g PB2

1 tbsp 2x madagascar vanilla

15g all purpose flour

1 tbsp baking powder (seriously)

215g no salt cottage cheese

42g (1.5 oz) egg white protein

1.25 cup egg white

Cinnamon

Salt

2 tbsp canola oil

1 tbsp molasses

100g semisweet chocolate chips

1/2 tbsp butter for pan

&nbsp;

Combine everything but chocolate chips in food processor and blend. Add chocolate chips. Bake at 350 for 25-30 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean.
