<u></u>_DB thinks one could actually get away with 2 lbs of carrots and 1/3 cup white sugar. This is basically a way to make carrots palatable for him, and he can eat mountains of this stuff. Depending on the details, expect 130-200 calories per cup._

_ _

  * 1.5 lbs carrots
  * 2 lbs cranberries
  * ½ cup white sugar
  * 8 clementines + zest of 3 clementines (substitute 1 orange for 2 clementines)
  * ¼ cup chia seeds
  * ¾ tsp cinnamon
  * Dash of salt
  * (optional) 75g toasted, chopped walnuts
  * (optional) 2-3 peeled, chopped sour apples
  * (optional) 1 cup unsulphured prunes, simmered at very low heat for ~30 minutes and cut into quarters
  * (optional) 1.5 lbs baked pears, cut into small pieces

Grate carrots in food processor and set aside. Put the chopping blade in the food processor. Combine cranberries, zest, sugar, and four of the clementines  in the food processor. Combine all ingredients in a large bowl. Allow to sit for about a half an hour, stirring once or twice, to get all the chia seeds soaked. Transfer to a large container and refrigerate overnight.
