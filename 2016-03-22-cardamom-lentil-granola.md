_Notes for next time: try 300F, and check every 15 minutes. Try more cardamom, and measure next time._

  * 8 oz dry red lentils
  * Â½ cup maple syrup
  * 2 tbsp olive oil
  * Several shakes salt
  * Pinch of ground cardamom

Preheated oven to 250F. Boiled lentils for five minutes, then drained. Combined all ingredients in a bowl. Spread onto a baking sheet covered with parchment paper. Baked for about 80 minutes, checking every 15-20 minutes. Edges of pan were crispy, but remainder were soggy. Increased heat to 325. Part of pan was overdone; remainder was still raw. Reduced to 300F, cooked for 10 more minutes. This seemed about right. Allowed to cool before transferring to jar.
