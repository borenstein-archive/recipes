# Mushroom gravy

Rough notes so I don't forget. I made this to go with my "The Pardon" roast by No Evil foods. Worked very well.

- I had leftover sauteed crimini mushrooms that were equivalent to probably 8oz uncooked. Anticipating today's gravy-making, they contained the drippings from a batch of Impossible Burgers that we had made the night before. I did a fine chop / coarse mince and set them aside. 
- I took two small shallots and minced them very finely.
- I heated 2-3 tbsp of cultured, unsalted butter with a similar amount of olive oil until quite hot. To this, I added a generous amount of asafoetida, and let it fry until darkened. Then I reduced the heat to medium and added the shallots, gradually lowering the heat until they were somewhere between fried and sauteed.
- At this point, I added the already-cooked mushrooms and let them heat back up and absorb the remainder of the fat. 
- This being done, I returned the heat to medium and gradually added 1/2 cup all-purpose wheat flour, constantly turning with a spatula. The mushroom-shallot mixture began to coagulate into clumps resembling quorn grounds.
- I then added a little under 4 cups of Pacific mushroom broth, constantly stirring until it was totally incorporated. It pulled the flour away from the mushrooms and shallots, presumably along with a great deal of flavor.

The resulting gravy was 100% legit.
