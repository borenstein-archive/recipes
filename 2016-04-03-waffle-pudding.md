Slam dunk! Use a similar batter for, eg, oatmeal pudding or rice pudding. We both really loved it. Note, though, that the psyllium in the waffles messed up the texture a bit by the second day. Consider slicing some apples or pears very thin and arranging them on the bottom of the casserole.

About 4 waffles’ worth of shredded old waffles and pancakes (probably about 6 cups)

  * 2 cups egg white
  * 1 cup 2% milk
  * 1 ¼ cup lowfat cottage chese
  * ¾ cup lowfat sour cream
  * 2 tbsp cider-vanilla paste
  * 1 tsp vanilla (more if not using waffles containing vanilla)
  * 1 tsp SS pistachio extract
  * 2 tbsp sugar
  * ½ tbsp molasses

Preheat oven to 350. Spray casserole with canola oil and put waffles in it. Whisk the remaining ingredients in a bowl. Pour over waffles. Bake for 1 hour. Let cool. Easy!
