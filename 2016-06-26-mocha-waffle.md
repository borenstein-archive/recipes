When you add chocolate chips to a psyllium waffle, the timing just gets that much more sensitive. You need to blend everything but the psyllium and chips. Then, with the chips already measured out, add the psyllium and blend briefly: five to ten seconds should be fine. Finally, for the chips, you have two choices: you can turn the Vitamix to 2 and pulse them in, or you can pour the batter into a bowl and stir in the chips.

Note to self: I doubled the recipe from the underlying Word document while posting this here, so check the quantities the next time I make this.
