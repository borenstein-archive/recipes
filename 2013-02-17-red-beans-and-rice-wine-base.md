New Orleans got me thinking about red beans and rice, and [this post in the NY times](http://www.nytimes.com/recipes/1014548/Red-Wine-Pinto-Beans-with-Smoky-Bacon.html) got me thinking about red wine bases for beans. This involves some juggling&#8211;probably not a great recipe for beginners.

</div>

1 bottle red wine  
1 large sweet onion, chopped  
1 large green bell pepper, chopped  
12 oz Andouille sausage, shredded  
4 oz bacon  
1 tsp dried rosemary  
2 bay leaves  
zest of one lemon  
juice from 1/2 lemon  
2 tbsp malt vinegar  
1 lb red beans  
4-6 cloves garlic, minced  
1/2 piece kombu &#8212; optional, makes beans more tender  
Salt to taste

  1. Soak beans overnight.
  2. In a medium saucepan, combine rosemary, bay leaves and wine. Let simmer for 30 minutes over medium heat.
  3. Meanwhile, drain beans and put with the kombu in a medium pot, with enough water to cover + 1&#8243;. (You can always add a little more and drain some if you&#8217;re worried.) Bring to a simmer, cover and let cook for 35 minutes or until tender.
  4. Meanwhile, in a large, heavy pot, cook the bacon as slowly as you can to get as much fat out as possible. Remove the bacon to a plate and set aside.
  5. Cook the onions and garlic in the bacon fat until soft. Add the peppers and cook together until very soft, about 15 minutes.
  6. Take the kombu out of the bean mixture. DO NOT DRAIN!
  7. Strain the wine reduction into the pot with the onions. Combine everything into this pot.
  8. Mash the beans a little bit with a masher. This releases starch and causes the stew to thicken.
  9. Cover and let simmer for 20 minutes, adjusting with salt and vinegar as necessary.
