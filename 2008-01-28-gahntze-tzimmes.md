Tzimmes, a sweet, heavy, root vegetable side dish, is made <span style="font-style: italic;">gahntz</span>&#8211;whole, full&#8211;when cooked with beef or chicken. It is served at most holidays, especially Passover, when the high fiber content is particularly welcome. This New England adaptation makes use of one of our most beloved local vegetables: the butternut squash.

If you happen to dislike slow cookers (but <span style="font-style: italic;">why</span>?), you could prepare this the old-fashioned way by blasting it in a 400 degree oven for an hour, and then turning it down to 300 and blasting it for 4-5 hours more. (Yeah, I&#8217;ll take the slow cooker.)

Obviously, this thoroughly Yiddish dish can be prepared kosher (fleishig).

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 1 small (2 &#8211; 2 1/2 lb) butternut squash, peeled, seeded and diced
  * 1 1/2 lbs sweet potatoes, peeled and diced
  * 1 lb. carrots, peeled and sliced (or baby carrots)
  * 2 lbs. flanken or brisket, chopped into pieces (or cut the meat off 4 lbs. of short ribs)
  * 1 lb. dried fruit (usually prunes and apricots)
  * 1 cup orange juice
  * 2 tbsp. brown sugar
  * 2 tbsp. flour
  * 2 tbsp. lemon juice
  * Several cups boiling water
  * Ground cloves
  * Ground nutmeg
  * Ground allspice
  * A dash of ginger (optional)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS (LAZY):</span> 

  1. Put the beef, carrots, squash, potatoes and dried fruit in the slow cooker.
  2. Combine the brown sugar, flour and spices. Add some of the boiling water so it all dissolves.
  3. Pour this over the tzimmes. Pour enough boiling water in that it&#8217;s near the top of the tzimmes. Turn heat to low and let cook for 8-10 hours.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS (AMBITIOUS):<br /></span> 

  1. Preheat the oven to 400.
  2. Place the vegetables and dried fruit at the bottom of a casserole and combine.
  3. Brown the beef in a deep skillet, then place on top of fruit and vegetables.
  4. Add the orange juice to the skillet and deglaze with a spatula. Transfer to a bowl and whisk in brown sugar, flour and spices.
  5. Pour over tzimmes. Pour enough boiling water in that it&#8217;s near the top of the tzimmes.
  6. Bake, covered, at 400 for an hour.
  7. Reduce heat to 300 and bake for another 4-5 hours.

Serve hot. Even better left over.
