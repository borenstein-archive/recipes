This is one of my favorite comfort foods, and it&#8217;s very easy if you have leftover potato knish filling (or any mashed potatoes, really). I find that the knish filling really made a perfect topping for the shepherd&#8217;s pie.

The potato knish filling is essentially just mashed potatoes prepared a particular way, and I don&#8217;t feel like writing it again, so I refer you to that recipe.

If prepared appropriately, this recipe can be kosher (fleishig).

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 6 cups potato knish filling (see below)
  * 1 lb. green peas, fresh or frozen
  * 1 lb. lean ground beef
  * 2 tbsp. brown mustard
  * 3 tbsp. ketchup
  * 1 tbsp. molasses
  * Worcestershire sauce
  * Yolk of one egg

<span style="font-weight: bold;">RECIPE:</span> 

  1. Preheat oven to 425.
  2. If peas are frozen, defrost in the microwave.
  3. Crumble and brown the beef in a frying pan, stirring frequently.
  4. When the beef is brown on the outside, add the mustard, ketchup, molasses, and Worcestershire sauce to taste. Cook for another minute or so.
  5. Transfer beef mixture to a casserole dish.
  6. Top beef with peas.
  7. Spread knish filling evenly over the peas using a spatula.
  8. Beat the egg yolk together with some more worcestershire sauce or some water; brush onto top of pie.
  9. Bake for 25-30 minutes or until the top is somewhat crisp and the egg mixture has turned golden brown.

Serve warm with a green salad.
