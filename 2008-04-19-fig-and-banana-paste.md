This rich, smooth fruit and nut butter is one of the most attractive toppings for crackers or bread that I&#8217;ve ever tasted. It is a dark, intense paste with the consistency of peanut butter and a rich, aromatic body. Top with a bit of goat cheese on toasted baguette for a formidable hors d&#8217;oeuvre.

I originally posted it as a Sephardic <span style="font-style: italic;">charoseth</span> recipe, and indeed it is [based on one](http://www.epicurious.com/articlesguides/holidays/passover/charosetrecipes/recipes/food/views/234300), but I simply felt it was unfair to limit it to that role.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 20 black mission figs
  * 1/4 cup raisins (dark or golden)
  * 1 banana
  * 1/4 cup very sweet red wine
  * 3 tbsp. honey
  * 3/4 cup walnuts
  * 3/4 cup almonds (chopped, slivered or sliced)
  * 1 tsp. fresh ginger
  * 1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon
  * 1 tsp. nutmeg
  * 1 tsp. allspice
  * 1 tsp. cloves
  * 1 fresh jalapeño, stem and seeds removed (optional)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Put the figs in a food processor and puree for about a minute. (You may want to <span style="font-weight: bold;">hold onto the food processor</span> for this.)
  2. Add the banana, honey and wine and jalapeño to the food processor and continue to pulverize for another minute or two.
  3. Add the nuts and spices and continue to process until smooth, which may take several minutes.

Refrigerate if preparing ahead of time. Serve at room temperature.<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
