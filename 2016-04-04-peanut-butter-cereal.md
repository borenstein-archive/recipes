_I was trying to make a peanut butter banana cereal. I had no idea that it would turn into a paste that looks just like peanut butter. It really needs toppings—one solution would be to eat only half the batch (thus saving the calories) and spend the other half on chocolate chips, sliced bananas and heated-through frozen berries._

_Note that I only used ¼ cup each oat bran and oatmeal because I ran out of oat bran. I bet it comes out the same with bran only._

  * ¼ cup oat bran
  * ¼ rolled oats
  * 36g PB2
  * 1 cup milk
  * ½ cup egg white
  * 1 banana
  * 1 tbsp (12g) chia seeds
  * ½ tbsp. molasses
  * 1 capful vanilla

Heat all ingredients in microwave for 3 minutes. Transfer to blender and blend until thick and sticky like peanut butter.
