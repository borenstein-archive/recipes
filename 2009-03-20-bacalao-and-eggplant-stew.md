I had tried this concept once before, using a Nigerian fish stew recipe as a base. I didn&#8217;t like the way that turned out, and I despaired of how to pull this off until I took [Emilie Hardman](http://www.consciouskitchen.net/)&#8216;s &#8220;Creative Vegan Cuisine&#8221; class at the Cambridge Center for Adult Education. There she made an eggplant and tofu stew with a tomato base. I decided to use that as a launching point for this summery meal.

1 jalapeño is quite mild. 2 is right around medium. Adjust to taste.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 1 lb. bacalao, soaked overnight in three changes of ice water
  * 2 zucchinis, cut into 3/4&#8243; cubes
  * 1 lb. eggplant, cut into 3/4&#8243; cubes
  * 1 large red onion, [diced](http://tofuvavohu.blogspot.com/2008/10/how-to-dice-onion.html)
  * 1 28 oz. can diced tomatoes
  * 6 cloves garlic, [crushed](http://tofuvavohu.blogspot.com/2008/06/how-to-crush-garlic.html)
  * 2 jalapeño peppers, seeds removed and finely minced
  * 2 tbsp. fish sauce
  * 1/3 cup water
  * 2 tbsp. minced ginger
  * 2 tbsp. cider vinegar
  * 3 tbsp. lime juice
  * 2 tbsp. olive oil
  * 1 1/2 tbsp. tomato paste
  * 1 tbsp. honey

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan. Add the diced onion and sauté until soft, about 3-4 minutes.
  2. Add the garlic, jalapeño and ginger. Sauté another 3-4 minutes or until soft.
  3. Add the eggplant and zucchini and sauté until the eggplant begins to soften.
  4. Add all ingredients except for fish. Simmer, covered, for 20 minutes.
  5. Meanwhile, dry the bacalao thoroughly with paper towels. Broil on high heat for about 4-6 minutes or until just done.
  6. Add the bacalao to the stew. Turn heat to low and allow to cook for 2 minutes more.

Serve immediately with rice or quinoa.
