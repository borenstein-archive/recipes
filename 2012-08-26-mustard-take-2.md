I made a new batch of mustard, identical to the first except for two things:

  * 30% yellow mustard seeds (3 oz yellow, 7 oz brown).
  * Coarse grind&#8211;only 3 minutes.

  The flavor of the new mustard, immediately after grinding, was much milder than the flavor of the old mustard, which is now more than a month old.

  That said, there&#8217;s less than 1 cup of mustard left from the first batch. That means that I went through more than <i>three cups of mustard</i>&nbsp;in a month. Evidently, I liked it just fine&#8230; <img src="http://www.davidbruceborenstein.com/vegepedia/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

    This batch was extremely well-received by the people to whom I gave each jar. My brother in law said the only thing that makes it less than perfect is that it had too much kick. So I will go for even more yellow next batch.
