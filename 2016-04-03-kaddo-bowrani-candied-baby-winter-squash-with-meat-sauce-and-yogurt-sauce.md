_This is my favorite of all restaurant dishes anywhere. It comes from the Helmand restaurant in Cambridge, MA. I finally decided to make it, using an adaptation of my “dandy Josephine” recipe (fancy, high end sloppy joes) and a half cottage cheese raita. The process of candying the squash is straight from Helmand, and I just doubled the proportions because a butternut squash is much bigger than a baby pumpkin._

_This recipe uses freshly roasted tomatoes. This takes little effort, but lots of lead time—best to do this before. Roasted tomatoes can be frozen, so I made a huge amount of them in the summer and put them in the freezer._

_For the squash:_

  * 1 large-ish butternut squash, peeled and cut into 2” strips*
  * 1 cup sugar
  * ½ cup neutral vegetable oil, such as canola

_For the “meat” sauce:_

  * 1 package quorn crumbles
  * 3 lbs tomatoes (I had frozen some), cut into quarters or eighths
  * A bunch of olive oil, very divided use
  * 6-8 cloves garlic
  * ¼ tsp asafetida
  * ½ tsp Cassia cinnamon (or 1 tsp regular cinnamon)
  * ~1 tbsp high quality balsamic vinegar, such as Giuseppi Giusti 2-star (see below)
  * ½ oz dried porcini mushrooms
  * 3 tbsp grated parmesan
  * 1 tsp tomato paste
  * 3/8 tsp salt (maybe more)

_For the yogurt sauce:_

  * ½ cup lowfat cottage cheese
  * ½ cup nonfat greek yogurt
  * 1 tbsp olive oil
  * Juice and zest of one lemon
  * 2-3 cloves garlic
  * 1 tsp mango powder
  * 1/8 tsp salt (maybe more)
  * 3” of a peeled, seedless cucumber, or 4” without seeds of a regular cucumber
  * ¼ tsp red pepper flakes (optional)

To prepare the tomatoes (may be done days before and refrigerated, or months before and frozen):

  1. Preheat the oven to 350F.
  2. Put about 3 tbsp olive oil in the bottom of each of two baking dishes.
  3. Arrange the tomatoes, cut side down, in the dishes.
  4. Bake for about 2 to 2.5 hours, until the tomatoes are mottled brown and super sweet.

To make the squash:

<ol start="5">
  <li>
    Preheat oven to 350F.
  </li>
  <li>
    Put ¼ cup of oil each in two large frying pans. Heat the to medium and put the squash in. Let cook for 5 minutes per side, covered. Turn down/off before turning over so you don’t get splattered.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once the squash is done, spread it into two baking dishes. Sprinkle ¼ cup of sugar over each baking dish, then turn the pieces over and sprinkle another ¼ cup into each dish (1 cup total). Cover the squash tightly with foil and bake for 30 minutes.
  </li>
</ol>

To make the “meat” sauce:

<ol start="8">
  <li>
    Meanwhile, put the tomatoes in the blender. Add about 1 ¼ cup water. Blend.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add vinegar, 1 tsp at a time, until the mixture is just a bit sweet. The exact amount depends on the ripeness of the tomatoes, but expect about a tablespoon.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the porcinis and the tomato paste and blend until smooth.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mince and mash the garlic, then transfer to a mortar and pestle with the salt, asafetida and 1 tbsp olive oil. If no mortar and pestle, mash the garlic and then mix these ingredients thoroughly in a bowl. Then buy a mortar and pestle.
  </li>
  <li>
    Heat 3 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan to medium-high. Once hot, add the garlic mixture and let cook until golden. Add the quorn and cook until it looks just like well-cooked hamburger. Add the tomato mixture. Deglaze the blender with another ½ cup water and add this to the sauce mixture. Add the parmesan and the cinnamon. Reduce heat to low and cover. Allow to simmer like this for about 10 minutes.
  </li>
</ol>

To make the yogurt sauce:

<ol start="13">
  <li>
    Meanwhile, mash the garlic for the yogurt sauce. Put it in the mortar and pestle with the mango powder, salt, hot pepper (if using), and lemon zest.
  </li>
  <li>
    Put the cottage cheese, the spice mixture, the olive oil, the lemon juice, and the cucumber in the food processor and blend until completely smooth and creamy. There should be no sign this was ever cottage cheese.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add the yogurt and blend briefly. (Yogurt gets screwed up if you beat it too much.)
  </li>
</ol>

Okay, you’re done, eat.

* For peeling and cutting butternush squash, nothing beats a vegetable cleaver and the following peeler:

Butternut squash used to be intimidating. Now I can reduce a brand new one to a pile of cubes in 120 seconds. (I timed it.) Don’t bash with the cleaver—just gently push it in and then rock it with some pressure from the top until it goes through.
