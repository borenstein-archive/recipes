_I used vegetable broth in which cauliflower had previously been simmered, and I also added high-end vegetable boullion. I don’t think HK liked either of these effects, so avoid both._

  * Handful dried porcinis (probably ~1/2 oz)
  * 4 cups vegetable broth
  * 4 cups water
  * Pinch saffron (~1/8 tsp)
  * 2 tbsp reduced-sodium tamari
  * 3-4 tbsp butter
  * ¾ tsp asafetida
  * ¼ cup flour
  * 1 large shallot, minced
  * Twist of black pepper

Combine porcinis, water, tamari, saffron, and vegetable broth. Simmer until reduced by half. Remove porcinis, mince, and set aside. Set aside liquid separately.

Heat butter in small saucepan. Add asafetida and allow to dissolve. Add shallots; allow to cook until just turning golden (1-2 minutes). Add minced porcinis and cook 1-2 minutes more.

Add flour a little at a time, scraping constantly with a rubber spatula.  Continue scraping constantly for about a minute more, until the mixture has browned somewhat.

Begin adding the broth mixture a dash at a time, thoroughly blending with your spatula before adding more. You want an increasingly thin-but-smooth paste until it eventually becomes a thick liquid. Add pepper to taste.

Once all of the broth is totally combined with the flour roux, bring to a low boil and cook until reduced by half—about 20 minutes.

Makes 2 cups.
