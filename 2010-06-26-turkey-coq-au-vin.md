<span style="font-weight: bold; "> 

<div>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">This is really the same recipe as my rabbit in red wine sauce, with some proportions adjusted and some other minor tweaks. (I&#8217;ve learned a few things since then.)</span>
</div>

</div>

<div>
  <span style="font-weight: normal;">The obvious difference is that it&#8217;s made with turkey, not rabbit. Boneless turkey thigh is good because it sears well and braises well, and this recipe does both.</span>

<p>
  INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      1 boneless turkey thigh (about 2 lbs), cut into 4 oz pieces
    </li>
    <li>
      1 cup flour
    </li>
    <li>
      2 tsp. coarse salt
    </li>
    <li>
      1/2 lb bacon
    </li>
    <li>
      1 medium Spanish onion, diced
    </li>
    <li>
      1 small head of garlic, crushed
    </li>
    <li>
      8 oz crimini mushrooms, sliced
    </li>
    <li>
      1 bottle red wine (preferably Pinot Noir)
    </li>
    <li>
      2 tbsp. black currant or blackberry preserves
    </li>
    <li>
      2 bay leaves
    </li>
    <li>
      1 tsp. dried rosemary
    </li>
    <li>
      Juice of 2 large lemons
    </li>
    <li>
      Freshly ground black pepper
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold; ">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place flour and the kosher salt into a large bowl or zip-loc bag. Coat each piece of turkey in this mixture and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a heavy skillet, sauté the bacon slices medium-high heat until somewhat crispy. Remove the bacon to a bowl <span style="font-weight: bold; ">but leave all the grease in the skillet.</span>
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase the heat to high. Brown the turkey pieces in the bacon grease briefly, about 30 seconds per side, and transfer to a large casserole.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sauté the onions and garlic until softened, adding a little olive oil if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the onions begin to soften, add the mushrooms and sauté the mixture until golden. Transfer contents to the casserole.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1 cup of wine to the skillet and gently scrape the sides with a spatula.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the deglazed wine into the casserole and combine with the rest of the wine, herbs, pepper, lemon juice, and preserves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Crumble the bacon into the casserole and mix all ingredients. Cover and refrigerate for 12-24 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span style="font-weight: bold; ">The next day</span>, preheat the oven to 275 ºF.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover casserole and let cook for about 2 hours.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
      Serve with mashed potatoes or egg noodles.
