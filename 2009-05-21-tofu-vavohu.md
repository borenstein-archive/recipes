At last, a stew that does justice to the namesake of this site. Dark and profound, this sweet stew has its roots in Korean braised beef and ma po tofu. I am quite pleased with it.

The peppers provide an important flavor dimension, so if you&#8217;re averse to spice, replace the 6 jalapeños with 3 poblanos. The jalapeño version is surprisingly moderate, however.

Notes: I tried cutting the peppers thin and adding them directly rather than roasting them separately; this turned out poorly. Chopped up steak, particularly cuts that tenderize well in stews, is better than hamburger. Chop in a food processor or slice into small pieces as preferred. You can replace up to 1/4 cup rice vinegar with lemon juice (1 lemon = 1/4 cup vinegar); in this case, add more sugar to offset the additional acidity.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:</span> 

  * 2 lbs. soft tofu, cut into 3/4&#8243; cubes
  * 3/4 lb eggplant (1 large), cut into 1&#8243; cubes
  * 1/2 lb ground beef
  * 6 whole jalapeños (or 3 whole poblanos)
  * 2 packages (10 oz. each) crimini mushrooms, cleaned and quartered
  * 1 cup reduced-sodium tamari
  * 1/2 cup rice vinegar
  * 1/2 cup light brown sugar
  * 2 tbsp. cornstarch

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Broil the peppers on high for 6-8 minutes, turning once.
  2. Combine rice vinegar, tamari and brown sugar in a small bowl and set aside.
  3. Combine tofu, beef, eggplant and mushrooms in a stew pot. Bury the peppers in the mixture. Pour vinegar mixture over these ingredients.
  4. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Simmer covered for an hour, stirring every ten minutes until liquid covers all the vegetables.
  5. Remove several tablespoons of liquid in a cup. Add one tablespoon cold water, then combine with corn starch. Quickly stir this mixture back into the stew.

Garnish with grated carrots or beets. Serve with steamed bok choy and brown ale.
