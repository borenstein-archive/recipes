The goal here is to make these healthy enough to be run-of-the-mill food, without ruining them. I happened to make them as muffins because (a) I don’t have a small square baking pan, (b) I like the extra crust, and (c) I find muffins convenient from a portability and portion-control standpoint.

The results were pretty good, but are not there yet. They are too salty and too moist, and not sweet enough.

The salt is no doubt because the cottage cheese adds extra salt. There was also a hint of bitterness. I think all three problems can be solved at once. “Cream-style corn” is actually regular corn, the kernels somewhat broken up, with cornstarch added. The result has a bit of extra sweetness and corn taste, which presumably is the appeal, but it is also bitter and, well, kind of unattractive. The bitterness is probably masked in the original recipe by the generous fat.

Replace the creamed corn with no-salt-added corn. Only replace the one can for now—incremental steps. Drain it, and add just a bit more sour cream. See how it looks and adjust.

I also want to make it a bit richer. Try adding 1tbsp each milk powder and buttermilk powder. And add a bit more sugar, especially since the creamed corn adds some sweetness that we’re losing.

Nutritionally, they’re fine, though they don’t stand on their own—one would need to eat them as a side with something else. I’d serve them with baked beans in a heartbeat.

Cornbread copycat mix recipe found here:

<http://www.food.com/recipe/jiffy-corn-muffin-mix-copycat-345502>

A package of cornmeal is 8.5 oz, which I misinterpreted as fluid ounces. So I reduced the above recipe, getting at total of 6oz or so. This was a mistake, but I’ll work from there since I know the results.

  * ½ cup flour
  * 1/3 cup cornmeal
  * 2 tbsp sugar
  * 2 tsp baking powder
  * ¼ tsp salt
  * ½ cup lowfat sour cream
  * ½ cup lowfat cottage cheese
  * 3 tbsp butter
  * 1 egg
  * 1 can (14.75oz) “cream-style” corn
  * 1 can (15 oz) sweet corn, drained

Preheat oven to 350F. Put the butter, sour cream, cottage cheese and egg in the food processor and grind until totally smooth. Combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix thoroughly. Bake at 350F for 50 minutes.
