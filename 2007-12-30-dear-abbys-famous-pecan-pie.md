<span style="font-family: arial;">This is a delicious pecan pie. Everyone loves it. It was in Abigail Van Buren&#8217;s column a long time ago, and I saved it. It was so hard to find it today, that I am glad to save it in this blog. Milton Borenstein loved this pie.</p> 

<p>
  You will need:
</p>

<p>
  9-inch unbaked pie crust
</p>

<p>
  1 cup light corn syrup<br />1 cup firmly packed dark brown sugar<br />3 large eggs, slightly beaten<br />1/3 cup butter, melted ( I use unsalted, she probably did not&#8230;)<br />1/3 tsp salt<br />1 tsp vanilla<br />1 heaping cup of pecan halves ( Halves look pretty )
</p>

<p>
  </span> 
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Heat oven to 350 degrees
    </li>
    <li>
      In a large bowl, combine corn syrup, sugar, eggs, butter, salt and vanilla; mix well. Pour filling into unbaked pie crust; sprinkle with pecan halves.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bake at 350 degrees for 45 to 50 minutes or until center is set. ( Toothpick or knife inserted in center will come out clean when pie is done.) Cool.
    </li>
    <li>
      If crust or pie appears to be getting brown while cooking, cover that section with foil for the remaining baking time.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can top it with a bit of whipped cream, but even plain, nothing tops this!
    </li>
    <li>
      Serves 8-10
    </li>
    <li>
      TIP:The original recipe stated that the pie should be baked 45-50 minut4es in a preheated 350 degree GAS oven. If an electric oven is used, it may be necessary to add 15 to 20 minutes to the baking time. ( Begin testing the pie with a toothpick after 45 minutes.)
    </li>
  </ul>
