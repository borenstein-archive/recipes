_Originally dates 11/4/14. As made, not as recommended. Revision on previous recipe. See notes._

**INGREDIENTS**:

  * 1 1/2 cup oat bran
  * 1/3 cup flaxseed meal
  * 1/4 cup brown sugar
  * 1/4 cup canola oil
  * 200g yam, peeled and shredded
  * 375g apple, peeled and shredded
  * 300g beets, peeled and shredded
  * 300g carrots, peeled and shredded
  * 1 1/2 cup egg white
  * 1 1/2 cup lactaid
  * 165 part skim ricotta
  * 1 tsp salt
  * 2 tsp baking powder
  * 1 1/2 tsp vanilla
  * 100g homemade dried cranberries
  * 2 tsp cinnamon

**DIRECTIONS:**

See previous, except as follows:

  * Mixed dry and wet ingredients separately, then combine. Pour into 3 buttered loaf pans.
  * For third buttered loaf pan, mixed in ~1/2 cup more oat bran and 2-3 tbsp more flaxseed. This was from the bottom of the bowl, so it probably also had less filling. Baked for ~1 hour at 350.

**NOTES:**

  * We both liked it. HK liked the dry variant better. HK does like the original variety as long as it hasn&#8217;t fallen apart to mush. Try just a bit more oat bran instead of the whole cup &#8212; say, 2 cups. Could also replace part of it with wheat germ.
  * The beets don&#8217;t help. Perhaps, leave them out and leave other vegetable ratios alone.
  * Since HK liked the dry variant, try putting ~1 cup more oat flour in the overall recipe with the reduced vegetable quantity as above. Also, the flaxseed meal does not seem to affect taste or texture, so OK to increase that as well.
  * No need for ricotta, which is high in fat (even part-skim). Try 0% greek yogurt or whipped cottage cheese.
  * Make sure to let it cool in the loaf pans before trying to get it out.
  * More cranberries. Could try some lemon zest.
  * Muffins still desired by both DB and HK.
  * Try more baking powder.
