I realized yesterday that I never added my two standard waffle recipes to this blog. These recipes are designed to make enough to fill a Vitamix blender. The trick with psyllium-based waffles is that you want to  blend everything but the psyllium until it&#8217;s smooth. Then add the psyllium and immediately blend before it thickens. Finally, transfer quickly to a bowl before it gets too thick to pour.

Note to selves: our circular waffle iron holds 3/4 cup waffle batter, and our square one holds 2 cups of waffle batter.

  * 4 tbsp butter
  * 2 1/2 cup Fage yogurt / cottage cheese / lowfat sour
  * Current recipe: ¼ cup LF sour, 1 cup LF cottage, 1.25 cup Fage
  * 4 large eggs
  * 1 1/2 cup egg white
  * 1 1/2 cup oat bran
  * 6 tbsp powdered buttermilk

  * 2 tbsp vanilla sugar
  * 1 tbsp. vanilla
  * 2 tbsp molasses
