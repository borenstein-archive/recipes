_Maybe try flavoring it, since I now know it’s so easy to make?_

_Uses for whey:_

_ _

½ gallon 2% lactaid milk

¼ cup inexpensive lemon juice

&nbsp;

Bring milk to a simmer. Add lemon juice and stir. It will separate quickly into curds and whey. Line a bowl with two layers of cheesecloth. Strain the panir through the cheesecloth. Set aside the whey for later use. Rinse the curds under water to remove the lemon (may be done through the cheesecloth). Serve.
