Based on [this recipe](http://www.cacaoweb.net/pasilla-mole.html), but a little more velvety and a couple of important points in the recipe clarified. This is actually a very healthy sauce if eaten in moderation.

INGREDIENTS: 

  * 4 dried pasilla peppers
  * 1 28-oz can roasted tomatoes
  * 1 medium yellow onion, chopped
  * 1 cup chicken broth
  * 1/4 cup pumpkin seeds, roasted (or raw, see below)
  * 3 tbsp raisins or black currants
  * 1/2 tsp ground cloves
  * 3/4 tsp cinnamon
  * 1 1/2 tbsp minced cilantro
  * several grinds of black pepper
  * 1 oz unsweetened chocolate
  * 2 oz bittersweet chocolate (I had 70% cacao)
  * 1 1/2 tsp salt

DIRECTIONS: 

  1. Soak the peppers in hot water for 10 minutes, turning once with a fork. Wearing gloves, remove the stems and discard.
  2. If pumpkin seeds are raw: put seeds in an untreated pan (<span style="font-weight: bold;">not </span>non-stick) and cook for 60-90 seconds, turning <span style="font-weight: bold;">constantly</span>, until temperature starts to change. Immediately transfer to plate or food processor; they will continue to cook once removed from the heat.
  3. Combine all ingredients <span style="font-weight: bold;">except chocolate</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">and salt </span>in a blender and process on high for 2 minutes.
  4. Transfer blended mixture to a large saucepan. Simmer, covered, for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  5. Add the chocolate and salt. Chocolate will melt instantly. Adjust salt if necessary. Serve or transfer to jars.

Makes about 5 cups.
