Heather prefers more sugar and cranberries and fewer pomegranate seeds

  * 250g pomegranate seeds
  * 250g cranberries, washed
  * 50g white sugar
  * 1/2 cup red wine
  * 1.5 tbsp lemon juice
  * 1 apple, sliced into 3/4&#8243; x 3/4&#8243; x 1/8&#8243; slices
  * 3 clementines, sections cut in half
  * 20g pomona&#8217;s universal pectin
  * 2 oz calcium water (calcium comes with pectin&#8211;see box), or as necessary
  * cinnamon stick
  * 40g chopped walnuts

  1. Put the pomegranate seeds, cranberries, wine, lemon juice, and sugar in a pressure cooker. Cook for 1 minute on high, then quick release.
  2. Meanwhile, blend the pectin with 1/2 cup of water for about 2 minutes in a blender. Stop occasionally to push pectin back down the sides. This may be easier in a blender that comes apart.
  3. After the pomegranate mixture is done, pour in pectin and stir until completely blended.
  4. Toast walnuts in a frying pan. Keep the pomegranate mixture right next to the frying pan, so that as soon as the walnuts are done, they can be poured into it to stop the walnuts cooking.
  5. Add in all the fruit and stir to combine.
  6. Add calcium water until the mixture starts to jell substantially. For me, this was about 2 oz
