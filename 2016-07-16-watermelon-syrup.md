&#8220;So basically, you took a wonderful thing and turned it into two not-so-great liquids.&#8221;

Indeed, this experiment did not initially seem to be shaping up well. Watermelon syrup was something I had thought of every time I&#8217;ve cut up a watermelon for the last couple of years. Look at all that liquid, I thought. Surely, if I just pureed it and boiled it down, I&#8217;d get a spectacular cocktail ingredient. But before reduction, the resulting slurry was about as appealing as, well, sugary celery soup.

Let me back up. I started by cutting up half a seedless watermelon and passing it through a blender. Then I took this puree and pushed it through a sieve, then a coarse mesh bag, then a fine mesh bag. At this point, I had a pale pink juice.

I began to heat the juice. Around the time that it began to boil, the solids began to coagulate. So I skimmed off the scum, turned off the heat, and poured the remainder through a coffee filter.

To my great astonishment, the remaining sweet liquid was yellowish-clear and highly vegetal in taste, a bit like cane juice crossed with butternut squash. The slurry of pulp and liquid that remained in the filter was more like a very sweet, weird pumpkin puree.

At this point, my curiosity forced me to go forward. I continued to reduce the molasses mixture. As I boiled it down, it went from off-clear to obscene yellow and finally to a maple syrup brown. Now we were getting somewhere. Taking a taste was a wave of sweet, indescribable tang. I was imagining something like molasses, but this was&#8230;different. I felt like I was in [one of those old spice commercials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drrBQwOnZB0).

I think the closest thing I can compare it to is [Dr. Brown&#8217;s Cel-Ray Soda](http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/10/dr-browns-cel-ray-celery-soda-history.html). It&#8217;s also got some notes of birch syrup. But neither comparison does justice to the fact that this stuff came from watermelons.
