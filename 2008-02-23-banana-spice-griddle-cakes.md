These are really cakes that are made in a pan, so calling them &#8216;pancakes&#8217; doesn&#8217;t get the point across. They puff up in excess of one inch apiece, and have a velvety cake texture. Made one fine shabbos morning when I discovered I had forgotten to plug in the slow cooker.

The trick to getting them to come out perfectly without raw centers is to begin flipping them over as soon as you can, and then to keep flipping them for several minutes. This might take some practice.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 1 1/2 cup white flour
  * 1 1/4 cup evaporated milk (nonfat is fine)
  * 3 tsp. baking powder
  * 1 extra large egg, beaten
  * 3 tbsp. butter, plus more for frying
  * 1/3 cup brown sugar
  * 2 tsp. vanilla
  * 2 tsp. cinnamon
  * 1/2 tsp. nutmeg
  * 1/2 cup walnut halves
  * 2 large, not-quite-ripe bananas, mashed
  * Pinch of salt

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS</span>: 

  1. In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, evaporated milk and beaten egg.
  2. In a skillet, melt 3 tbsp. butter over medium-high heat.
  3. To the skillet, add the bananas, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt. Cook for several minutes to blend.
  4. Add the banana mixture and nuts to the batter and mix thoroughly.
  5. Clean the skillet and heat to medium.
  6. Butter the skillet when it is completely hot.
  7. To the buttered skillet, add dollops of batter to meet your preferred size. (The cakes won&#8217;t spread much.)
  8. <span style="font-weight: bold;">As soon as it is possible to do so </span>(Maybe 30-60 seconds), begin to flip over the cakes. Flip them over every 30 seconds or so. They will be done after several minutes. (This depends on the heat of your stove, so try one and check to see how long it takes.)

Serve immediately.
