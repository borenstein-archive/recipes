  * 1 lb navy beans (reserve potliquor, see below)
  * 2 Vidalia onions, diced
  * 5 large cloves garlic, minced
  * 1 tsp asafetida
  * 2 small-ish Macoun apples, peeled and choped
  * ¼ cup olive oil
  * 100g dark brown sugar
  * 50g blackstrap molasses
  * 100g ketchup
  * 1 tsp Cedarhouse liquid hickory smoke
  * 1 heaping tsp sweet paprika
  * 4 tbsp cider vinegar
  * 8 g coarse salt
  * 1 tbsp Bourbon Barrel Foods vegan Worcestershire sauce
  * 1 cup potliquor from beans
  * 1 cup water
  * 1 cup Evan Williams bourbon
  * 60g homemade Dijon mustard

<u> </u>

  1. Prepare the navy beans. I’ve had good luck with pressure cooking, no soak, using 1 tbsp of olive oil to prevent foaming. The duration depends on the particular beans, from 17 minutes to as much as 20. Quick release only. Start at 17 minutes and then do 1 more at a time until finished. Drain promptly, reserving at least 1 cup of potliquor.
  2. Heat asafetida in oil. Caramelize garlic, onions, and apples in asafetida oil.
  3. Combine all ingredients except beans in the Instant Pot (or some other slow cooker). Whisk to thoroughly blend.
  4. Add beans. Slow cook medium for 7 hours, then leave on “keep warm” for 1-2 more hours.
