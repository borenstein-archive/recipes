_Everyone loves this. The iteration below is basically essence of baklava in a spread. I’m still refining the ingredients. I’m inclined to skip the canola oil entirely. (Although the mixture starts off very dry and pasty, it turns oily after the walnuts liquefy.) I also might use less sweetener, and replace some of the honey with sugar (maybe vanilla sugar?). The final taste can be sweeter than it is before it finishes processing. **Update: I reduced the honey in the recipe from 180g (original) to 120g.**_

  * 1 lb walnuts
  * 2 tbsp canola oil
  * ~120g honey
  * 1 tsp cinnamon
  * 5/8 tsp salt

Put walnuts in a ½ gallon jar (or similar size container) and soak in water for 24 hours. Preheat oven to 350F. Drain walnuts and arrange on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for about 30 minutes (but don’t let them burn). Throw everything in the food processor. Transfer to jars. Refrigerate. Makes 2 1/2 cups.
