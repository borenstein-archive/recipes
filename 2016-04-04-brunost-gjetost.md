_Use “acid” whey from fresh cheese (like ricotta or paneer) for a nearly straight caramel taste; use “sweet” whey from a cultured cheese or yogurt for the classic, salty-tangy taste. (“acid” whey from paneer is not sour, and “sweet” whey from yogurt is very sour—go figure.)_

8 cups whey, sweet or acid (see above)

1 cup heavy cream

  1. Boil the whey at high heat until it’s reduced to two cups. A splash guard is a good idea.
  2. Add the cream and continue to simmer at medium heat until it’s starting to change color. Adjust the temperature until it’s just below the temperature at which it starts to boil over. A splash guard is a REALLY good idea.
  3. Scrape constantly as it begins to change color. When it’s the color of light caramel, it’s done—transfer to a bowl immediately.
