This peanut sauce is extremely good on a variety of pastas and grains, and would likely do a nice job for poultry and fish as well. Based on [this recipe](http://www.jewish-food.org/recipes/saucsesa.htm), but adapted for more readily available ingredients.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 1/2 cup chunky peanut butter
  * 4 tbsp sushi vinegar (or 4 tbsp rice wine vinegar + 2 tbsp sugar + 1 tsp salt)
  * 1 tbsp. anchovy paste
  * 1 tbsp. sesame oil
  * 2 tbsp. tamari or soy sauce
  * 1/4 cup water
  * 2 cloves fresh garlic, minced
  * 2 tsp. fresh ginger, minced
  * Hot red pepper flakes to taste

Combine all ingredients in a nonstick saucepan; simmer until combined. Easiest to mix while still warm.
