Heat the olive oil in a soup pot and add the asafetida to dissolve. Add the cauliflower, broccoli and half the corn. Sweat the vegetables. Add the water and porcinis. Allow to come to a boil, then reduce heat and let simmer, covered, for **xx** minutes, until vegetables are soft. Stir in the milk. Blend in batches, then transfer back to pot. Add the remaining corn. Simmer on low until corn is soft. Add salt to taste. Serve.
