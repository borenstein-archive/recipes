This is a two-fer kind of recipe. After you&#8217;ve done it, you&#8217;ve got two wonderful things: candied citrus fruits, and citrus syrup.

Add water or seltzer to the syrup (along with lemon juice if you want it tart) and you&#8217;ve got a delicious beverage, iced or hot. For a beautiful <span style="font-style: italic;">mojito</span>, mix it with seltzer, lemon juice, rum and fresh mint. Pour hot over ice cream. The possibilities are endless. If you want to get fancy, you could throw a little mint or ginger in with the fruit while they&#8217;re cooking, which will further improve the syrup.

A lot of people use candied oranges or lemons as the base of a more complex candy, but I think they&#8217;re fine just like this. Muchas gracias to [this orange candy recipe](http://www.recipezaar.com/144348), which showed me that you really need an unbelievable amount of sugar for this to work.

If you&#8217;re new to cooking and don&#8217;t know what kinds of pots to use: for things that get very hot, such as frying oil or candy, you really want to stay away from nonstick and aluminum in favor of a non-reactive, heat-tolerant metal pan such as stainless steel or (if you can afford it), copper.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 2-3 lbs. oranges, lemons, limes or grapefruit
  * 5 cups granulated sugar (divided use)
  * 2 cups water
  * Dash of salt

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Slice the citrus fruits in half through the axis with the stems. (That is, if you had a navel orange, you&#8217;d be cutting the navel in half on one end, and the green stem at the other end.) Slice the halves into 1/4&#8243; thick slices<span style="font-weight: bold;">, leaving the peel intact.</span>
  2. In a deep, non-reactive skillet or a saucepan, add the water, salt and 3 cups of sugar and combine.
  3. Bring to a boil (<span style="font-weight: bold;">warning: </span>this will be <span style="font-style: italic;">much </span>hotter than 212Ëš F!).
  4. Add fruit with a slotted spoon and reduce to a simmer. Simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour, occasionally pushing down pieces that are on top.
  5. Turn off heat and allow the mixture to cool.
  6. Transfer the fruit to a cookie rack to dry.(You probably want to put something under that cookie rack.) <span style="font-weight: bold;">Don&#8217;t put them on top of each other or they&#8217;ll stick!</span>
  7. Strain the syrup through a fine strainer into a glass jar. The syrup will be very thick and have an intense, mildly bitter taste (like fresh marmalade).
  8. Allow the fruit to dry for 24 hours or more.
  9. Dredge the fruit in sugar.
 10. If you have time, you could let them dry for another day; otherwise, they&#8217;re ready to serve.

The candy will keep reasonably well in an airtight container. Arrange the fruit in layers, separated by wax paper, so they won&#8217;t stick together. Enjoy!
