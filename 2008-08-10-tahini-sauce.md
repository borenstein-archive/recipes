I have always loved the tangy, salty tahini sauce found atop falafel and other Arabic and Israeli snacks. Unfortunately, every menu in the universe identifies this stuff merely as &#8216;tahini,&#8217; which is obviously not the case: tahini by itself is heavy, astringent and a bit bitter. Every time I look for a recipe, all I find are instructions for how to grind sesame seeds into a paste (hint: smash them).

Today I decided to see if I could just throw something that approximates it together, and I actually got pretty close. Note that proportions are approximate as I was not measuring:

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 4 tbsp. tahini paste
  * 2 tbsp. lemon juice
  * 1 tsp. hot pepper sauce
  * 1 clove garlic, minced
  * 1 tsp. salt
  * 2-4 tbsp. water, depending on desired consistency

Combine all ingredients thoroughly in a bowl. Eat with pita bread or drizzle on other foods.

You can make kafta kabob by mixing hamburger with chopped red onion and parsley. Drizzling this sauce over a kafta kabob burger would be divine&#8230;
