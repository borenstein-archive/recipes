Before you ask, no, there isn&#8217;t a better name for it; and no, I have no idea what ethnicity it ought to be. I made it up a couple of years ago and make it a little differently each time. It makes a fantastic lunch with some pressed dates and white cheese.

Vidalia onions are sweeter than most other onions, and make an absolutely beautiful flavor when sautéed. They play very nicely off the buttery fava beans and the rough barley, and add a certain grandeur to the whole ensemble.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 1 lb. dry fava beans, reconstituted
  * 1 lb. barley
  * 6 cups chicken broth
  * 2 vidalia onions, sliced
  * 2-3 tbsp. butter or schmaltz
  * 3 tbsp. capers, chopped
  * 3 tbsp. lemon juice
  * 1 tin flat anchovy fillets, chopped
  * Freshly ground pepper to taste

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Reconstitute the fava beans by whatever method suits you best. (I usually throw beans in the slow-cooker on high for 4-6 hours.)
  2. Rinse the barley and place in a pot with the broth. Bring to a boil, then allow to simmer, covered, for 45-60 minutes or until all the broth is absorbed.
  3. Meanwhile, heat the butter or schmaltz in a deep nonstick pan. Once hot, add the onions.
  4. Sauté the onions over medium-high heat.
  5. When the onions begin to soften, add the chopped anchovies. Continue to sauté.
  6. Add the capers and black pepper when the onions begin to brown.
  7. When the onions have caramelized, add the fava beans and combine thoroughly, mashing slightly if necessary.
  8. Mix in the lemon juice and allow to cook on medium heat for several minutes.
  9. Add the onion-bean mixture to the barley and combine thoroughly.

Serve warm with feta cheese or other soft brined cheese (such as chêvre or Tek-Süt) and pressed dates or other dried fruit. Also good with olives. Makes an outstanding carry-in lunch.
