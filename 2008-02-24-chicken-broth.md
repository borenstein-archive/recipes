This is something I do all the time, and is so familiar to me that I never thought of it as a &#8216;recipe.&#8217; But after a conversation a couple weeks ago, it occurred to me that this is not at all obvious, so I&#8217;m writing it up. This broth comes out a rich, caramel color and has a hearty, thick texture. I use it in everything.

Broth freezes very nicely and will keep for several months in an airtight container. Freeze in several &#8216;portions&#8217; so that you don&#8217;t have to defrost more than you want. (Like anything else, defrosting broth and then freezing it again is a Bad Thing.)

This will seriously warm up your house. (In my thousand s.f. home, the temperature usually rises 3-4 degrees farenheit everywhere, and maybe 10-12 degrees in the kitchen!) Also, you are pretty much guaranteed to set off a smoke detector while you&#8217;re roasting the bones, so take whatever precautions are necessary. (If you choose to unplug your detectors, you&#8217;d better not leave the kitchen for even a second until you&#8217;re done roasting the bones!)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 8-10 lbs chicken necks and/or frames (any chicken will do, but these two products are extremely cheap&#8211;typically $0.50 &#8211; $0.80 / lb, or twice that for kosher).
  * 2-3 lbs onions, peeled and cut in quarters
  * 2 lbs carrots, cut into large pieces
  * Several bay leaves
  * Several whole peppercorns
  * Oil for sautéing

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Preheat the oven to 425˚ F.
  2. Arrange the chicken pieces on a large broiler pan. You may need two. Make sure it&#8217;s got one of those fat-drippy thingies.
  3. Roast the chicken for about 45 minutes, turning about halfway through. It should be dark brown.
  4. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Meanwhile, </span>sauté the carrots and onions in your stock pot over medium-high heat until the onions begin to turn golden, about 10-15 minutes.
  5. Transfer the chicken to the stock pot. Add the spices. Combine the ingredients gently.
  6. Add enough <span style="font-weight: bold;">cold</span> water to just cover the chicken and maybe a little more. This is usually about 4-5 quarts. (Don&#8217;t worry about this too much, as long as the chicken is covered; you can always add more water or reduce it.)
  7. Cover and bring to a boil. (This could take awhile with so much water.)
  8. Reduce heat to a simmer and continue to cook for another 2 1/2 &#8211; 3 hours or so. Add water as needed to keep the chicken covered. Including the time it was coming to a boil, you want it to go for about 3 1/2 hours. Less, and you under-extract the chicken; more and the bones begin to decalcify, turning the broth slightly bitter.
  9. Using [a long-handled metal strainer](http://static-p.arttoday.com/thw/thw13/PO/5344_2005020023/010924_0994_13/22912270.thw.jpg?010924_0994_1398_l__p) (or just a slotted spoon), remove most of the solid stuff in the pot as is convenient. Then, using a ladle and a fine strainer, strain the liquid into containers.
 10. If freezing, make sure the containers are about 1/3 empty so that the broth has room to expand.

You can also reduce the broth as much as you want once the bones have been removed; a very strong reduction becomes somewhat like a demi-glace and makes a fabulous base for a gravy. (Careful when doing this with kosher broth, as you are also concentrating the salt that comes in kosher meat.)
