This time, I really was trying. The following is an iteration of the &#8220;accidentally vegetarian baked beans&#8221; that I made awhile back. I used Arabic-style crispy onions to emulate the effect of bacon.

The recipe is written as executed, which came out very well. A couple of tweaks I would recommend:

  * Cook the beans **the first time&nbsp;**to the doneness you want **at the end**. Don&#8217;t cook them to firm because you figure they will get mushy. For whatever reason, they don&#8217;t soften up much in the slow cooker.

  * Vegan worcestershire sauce is, of course, not exactly the same as the kind with anchovies. There are many brands. Choose one, taste it, and adjust the other proportions.

  * I didn&#8217;t have any paprika, so it&#8217;s not in the recipe, but I still think it should have some.

  * Definitely needed more molasses. At least another tablespoon, maybe two.

  * I cooked the beans for 8 hours, plus one hour of resting, because that&#8217;s the time I had. It needs more. I&#8217;d say try around 12 hours cooking, plus 1 hour resting.

Based on this recipe for barbecued beans:
