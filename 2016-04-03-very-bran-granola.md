_This tastes very health food-y. It was supposed to be for HK, but I’m not sure she’s going to be into it. I used a ton of egg white because the oat bran and flax soaked up liquid like crazy. The Saigon cinnamon is incredibly potent—1/2 tsp of it felt like ½ tbsp (or more) of ordinary cinnamon, and it had a more sophisticated, spicier flavor. Great value on that stuff. ¼ tsp salt is probably OK, maybe a hair less._

  * 1 ½ cup rolled oats
  * 1 ½ cup oat bran
  * ¼ cup flaxseed meal
  * ½ cup quartered almonds
  * ¼ cup sugar
  * ½  tbsp molasses
  * 1 tbsp homemade vanilla (2x Madagascar A)
  * ½ tsp Saigon cinnamon (how much?)
  * 1 cup egg white
  * ¼ cup olive oil
  * 1/8 tsp salt

300F for 60 minutes. DO NOT STIR. It will still be a little soft when you take it out of the oven, but it  will crisp up as it cools.
