This is my attempt to distill what worked from a more experimental recipe. As such, it is written as recommended, rather than as executed.

  * 1 large can Goya low sodium black beans, rinsed and drained
  * 1/2 cup oat bran
  * 1/2 cup bread crumbs
  * 3-4 oz swiss cheese, grated
  * 1-2 oz parmesan cheese, grated
  * 1 large red onion, very finely [diced](http://www.wikihow.com/Dice-an-Onion)
  * 1-2 tbsp brown mustard
  * Sprinkle of sugar
  * ~1 tsp  [SSS herbs en douxelles](http://www.savoryspiceshop.com/blends/herbsdux.html)
  * Egg white (see below)

Combine all ingredients except egg white in a large bowl. With disposable gloves on, squeeze and knead the mixture between the fingers to blend. Add egg white a little at a time until the mixture has a consistency similar to hamburger. (This amount depends on the dryness of the beans, the breadcrumbs, and the cheese, so it cannot be determined in advance.)

At this point, there are two options. If cooked on medium heat over a skillet, you get a sort of chunky paste that would be good smeared over sourdough, or [as a smorrebrød topping](http://www.davidbruceborenstein.com/vegepedia//2016/07/04/mushrooms-with-yogurt-and-brunost/). (HK does not think it goes well with the mushrooms in the link, but I do.)

The other option, which I haven&#8217;t tried yet, is to preheat the oven, put some canola oil in a cast iron skillet, heat it to near smoking and absolutely blast each side of the burger before finishing it in the oven. This is how you cook a perfect beef or salmon steak&#8211;why not a veggie burger?
