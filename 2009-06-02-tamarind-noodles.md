This stir-fry pasta dish was intensely flavorful and produced a lot of good food for the cost.  
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br />INGREDIENTS:</span> 

  * 1 batch [sambal](http://tofuvavohu.blogspot.com/2009/06/sambal.html)
  * 1 head cauliflower, cut into florets
  * 1 1/2 lbs boneless, skinless chicken, sliced into 1/2&#8243; strips
  * 1 large red onion, halved and sliced
  * 1 package somen (or udon) noodles
  * 1 can sliced bamboo shoots, drained
  * Oil for saut√©ing
  * Tamari to taste

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS</span> 

  1. Begin to bring water for pasta to a boil.
  2. Bring the sambal to a boil and allow to cook for 3-4 minutes. Set aside.
  3. Heat the oil until quite hot; add the onions and allow to cook until soft.
  4. Add the chicken and bamboo shoots; allow to cook another 5 minutes, stirring frequently.
  5. Begin to cook the pasta; do not overcook. (This sort of pasta takes about 7-8 minutes.)
  6. Add the cauliflower, bamboo shoots and sambal to the chicken mixture and allow to cook for several minutes.
  7. Drain the pasta and add to the chicken mixture. Combine thoroughly and allow to sit for several minutes in order to combine the flavors.

Makes great leftovers.
