This meat kugel is inspired by Sephardic recipes for <span style="font-style: italic;">mina con carne</span>. If you avoid <span style="font-style: italic;">kitnyot</span> on Passover, substitute sliced carrots or more spinach for the peas. You can use honey and vinegar in place of the extra sweet red wine; I just wanted to get the stuff used up!

Note that you want ordinary matzo for these sorts of things. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Do not use whole wheat or egg matzo.</span>

Again, by &#8216;drained&#8217; spinach I mean really drained. It is necessary to squeeze out the water.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 2-3 matzos
  * 1 lb. ground beef or lamb
  * 1 yellow or Spanish onion, finely chopped
  * 1/2 cup raisins
  * 1 cup frozen peas, thawed
  * 3 tbsp. extra sweet red wine (or 2 tbsp. vinegar + 1 tbsp. honey)
  * 1 lb. frozen spinach, thawed and drained
  * 1 tbsp. tomato paste
  * 6 tbsp. olive oil
  * 1/2 tsp. ground allspice
  * 1/2 tsp. ground cloves
  * 3 eggs

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
  2. Soak the matzos in water for 2 minutes, then immediately press between paper towels to drain away excess moisture. This will make them flexible but not soggy.
  3. Coat a non-stick baking pan with 2 tbsp. oil, then cover the bottom with the matzos.
  4. In a saucepan, heat 2 tbsp. olive oil, then sauté the onions in the oil over medium-high heat until soft.
  5. Add the ground meat and sauté together for 3-4 minutes. When the meat is almost cooked, add the tomato paste, wine, peas, spinach and raisins. Allow to cook for another minute or two on low heat.
  6. In a separate bowl, beat eggs thoroughly. Combine with meat mixture and transfer to the pan with the matzos.
  7. Bake at 400 degrees for 50 minutes or until top is golden.
