I received this simple recipe from a colleague from work. He had red chili powder, but I wasn&#8217;t feeling up to that tonight, so I opted for an equal amount of paprika. These are simply sublime. These little fish are refreshing and delicious.

If you are an East Cambridge resident, you can get fresh Sardines at the New Deal Fish Market at the corner of Fulkerson and Cambridge. Across the street is Mayflower Poultry (&#8220;Live Poultry Fresh Killed&#8221;), where you can buy excellent meat on the cheap.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:</span> 

  * Sardines (8-10)
  * 2tbs Paprika or chili powder
  * 1tbs Turmeric powder (or my favorite, Madras Curry Powder)
  * 2tbs Lime Juice
  * 2 cloves fresh garlic, chopped
  * Salt to taste
  * 3-4 tbs olive oil to fry

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:</span> 

  1. Mix the salt (1 tsp or salt to taste), paprika (2 tbs), garlic, turmeric powder(1 tbs), and lime juice (1-2 limes) to form a thin paste. Marinate the sardines 1 hour. 
  2. In a pan put the oil, and after the oil is hot, reduce the flame and fry the fish at low flame for 5 mins and turn the side and fry it for another 5 mins. Make sure you don&#8217;t fry too much.

Serve immediately with any dry, structured white.
