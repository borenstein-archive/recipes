I thought ranch dressing had mayo, but then I saw an infographic in &#8220;The Visual Miscellaneum&#8221; by David McCandless. He claims that it consists of 1 part garlic, 1 part parmesan, 2 parts chives, 6 parts buttermilk, and 8 parts cottage cheese. My favorite things! I had to check this.

Turns out, it was pretty good. I used 2 parts parmesan, and I replaced the chives with a shallot because I didn&#8217;t have chives. It came out too garlicy/shalloty and too thin. Aside from that, it seemed like it had a lot of potential.

I thought that perhaps it would be better to use buttermilk powder and just a dash of milk to help it blend, since it gets so thin. I also think just garlic would be enough. And still more parmesan! So here&#8217;s my next try:

  * 1 cup lowfat cottage cheese
  * 1/4 ground parmesan
  * 3 tbsp buttermilk powder
  * 1-2 tbsp milk (sufficient to make it blend)
  * 1 large clove garlic
