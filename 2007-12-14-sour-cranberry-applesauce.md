I think this tart applesauce is absolutely delicious. It&#8217;s also very easy and you can use old apples for it. I&#8217;m planning on serving it with sweet potato latkes and sour cream. A variation I&#8217;d like to try is to use fresh rhubarb in addition to, or in place of, the cranberries. If you do that, compensate with extra lemon juice; rhubarb, though tart, is not as sour as cranberries.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 4-5 lbs. apples, peeled and cored (firm, crunchy apples like Granny Smith and Golden Delicious are good)
  * 12 oz. package fresh cranberries
  * 1/4 cup brown sugar
  * 2 tsp. nutmeg
  * 4 tsp. cinnamon
  * 1 tsp. whole allspice (or 1/2 tsp. ground)
  * 1/2 cup lemon juice
  * 3/4 cup water
  * Granulated sugar to taste (I used about half a cup)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">RECIPE:<br /></span> 

  1. Cut the apples into quarters. Combine all ingredients except white sugar in a pot.
  2. Heat until water is boiling, then reduce heat to a simmer, covered, for about 25 minutes.
  3. Mash with a potato masher, then begin adding granulated sugar and tasting until you&#8217;ve reached the desired level of sweetness. (Warning: this is going to be REALLY SOUR before you start adding the granulated sugar!)
