I honestly can&#8217;t believe I didn&#8217;t already have this recipe written up on the blog. Not a cold month goes by where I don&#8217;t make this at least once, either with beef or with dark meat chicken: both work equally well.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></p> 

<p>
  </span></span></span>Don&#8217;t bother making this soup if you don&#8217;t have homemade broth. <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span></span></span>The recipe is designed to emphasize each of the ingredients, so bad ingredients equal bad soup.
</p>

<p>
  As with lamb, the meat will become tough if you allow it to reach a boil. I should probably measure the actual temperature I use with a meat thermometer and put it here.
</p>

<p>
  The fundamentals are the use of mushrooms, onions, rosemary and butternut squash&#8211;and, of course, the technique. There is a good deal of give in how to make the stock. I often use a half a cup of fresh cider (or a bottle of hard cider or brown ale) in place of the apple. Use beers only with beef; avoid them with chicken. Do not use wine, light-colored beers or porters. Don&#8217;t use sweet potatoes; every time I try using sweet potatoes, I regret it.
</p>

<p>
  The recipe, as written, gives a soup so hearty you can almost eat it with a fork. Add more broth if desired.

<p>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      10 cups homemade <a href="http://tofuvavohu.blogspot.com/2008/02/chicken-broth.htmlhttp://tofuvavohu.blogspot.com/2008/02/chicken-broth.html">chicken broth</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      2 lbs. shoulder chuck, trimmed and cut into 1&#8243; cubes (or boneless chicken thighs, cut in half)
    </li>
    <li>
      1 sour apple, finely minced (food processor is fine)
    </li>
    <li>
      1 medium yellow onion, <a href="http://tofuvavohu.blogspot.com/2008/10/how-to-dice-onion.html">diced</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      10 oz. crimini mushrooms, sliced
    </li>
    <li>
      1 small (1 to 1 1/2 lb) butternut squash, cut into 3/4&#8243; cubes
    </li>
    <li>
      2 yukon gold potatoes, cut into 3/4&#8243; cubes
    </li>
    <li>
      4-6 cloves garlic, <a href="http://tofuvavohu.blogspot.com/2008/06/how-to-crush-garlic.html">crushed</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      1 cup barley, rinsed
    </li>
    <li>
      1/3 oz. fresh rosemary, removed from its stem
    </li>
    <li>
      1 tsp sugar
    </li>
    <li>
      Olive oil for sauteing
    </li>
    <li>
      Salt
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    <span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large soup pot, heat olive oil over medium-high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the beef and sear on all sides until brown. Remove and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add more olive oil if needed. Reduce heat to medium-low. Add the onions, garlic and sugar; sauté until the mixture begin to turn golden, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the mushrooms and continue to sauté for 5 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the apples and rosemary; continue to sauté for a few minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the dry barley and continue to sauté for 5 minutes more, stirring constantly. The barley will absorb liquid from the other ingredients and roast slightly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the beef and the remaining vegetables; mix thoroughly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour broth over mixture; cover and set heat to low. Allow to cook for approximately 1 1/4 hours, being careful to keep heat just below a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add salt to taste.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">PAIRINGS:</span> Serve with hard cider or brown ale.
