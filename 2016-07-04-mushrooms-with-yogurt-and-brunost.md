I originally prepared it as a burger topping, but I think it would go better as a smørrebrød topping&#8211;a smear of it, say, atop a piece of [rugbrød](http://www.epicurious.com/archive/blogs/editor/2013/11/discovering-danish-rye-bread-rugbrod-smorrebrod.html) with sliced cucumbers, thinly sliced red onion and chopped egg. If I had tarragon, I would have added it.

A note about [brunost](http://www.davidbruceborenstein.com/vegepedia//2016/04/04/brunost-gjetost/): I discovered this peanut-butter like reduction of whey and cream in Norway, where it is a traditional food. In Sweden, where I&#8217;ve spent more time, I&#8217;ve been told it is looked at with condescension as both old-fashioned and vaguely vile. (Indeed, it was mentioned in the same breath as [surströmming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surstr%C3%B6mming).)

I think it has a pretty remarkable taste, completely unique among anything I&#8217;ve ever eaten. It is a wonderful ingredient in sauces, where it imparts sweet, salt, savory, and creamy all at once. It plays great with intense flavors like mushroom and mustard. It&#8217;s a great use for whey that would otherwise be wasted.

In the US, it is known as &#8220;gjetost&#8221; (literally &#8220;goat cheese&#8221;), even when it is made from 100% cow&#8217;s milk. Remarkably, Wegman&#8217;s seems to carry it, although theirs is saltier and less sweet than I would like. It also lasts a long time: it seems to stay good as new for months.

**INGREDIENTS:**

  * 1 lb crimini mushrooms, scrubbed and sliced
  * 1-2 oz brunost, cut into small pieces
  * 2 tbsp butter
  * 1/2 cup 2% Fage yogurt
  * 2 tsp spicy mustard
  * 2 tsp flour
  * Coarse salt
  * Black pepper

Melt the butter in a wide saucepan over med-high heat. Add the mushrooms and sprinkle generously with salt. Toss until coated with butter, then cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until they begin to release a lot of water.

Turn the heat to high and sautee until most of the released water has boiled away. Add the brunost, reduce heat to low, and toss until it is well melted. Return heat to medium-high, sprinkle in the flour, and toss until the mixture has become a roux.

Lower the heat to medium. Add the mustard and the yogurt. Stir to combine, and continue cooking until heated through.
