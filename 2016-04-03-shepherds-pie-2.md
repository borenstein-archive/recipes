_This was a big success. HK doesn’t like the most recent batch of mustard. Use 2x more peas._

_Very loosely based on http://allrecipes.com/recipe/shepherds-pie-vi/_

  * 1kg Yukon gold potatoes, cut into 1” cubes
  * 200g carrots cut into ¼” cubes
  * 1 ½ cups frozen green peas
  * 2 tbsp butter
  * 2 eggs
  * 1 shallot, minced
  * ½ tbsp onion powder
  * ½ tbsp mustard
  * 2 tbsp lowfat sour cream
  * 4 oz shredded cheddar (I used TJ farmhouse cheddar)
  * 1 1/4 cup vegetable broth
  * ½ oz porcinis
  * 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
  * 12 oz quorn mince
  * 6 oz crimini mushrooms, scrubbed and quartered
  * ½ tsp asafetida
  * 1 tbsp ketchup
  * 1 tsp vegan Worcestershire sauce

DIRECTIONS:

  1. Preheat oven to 375F.

<ol start="2">
  <li>
    Put the porcinis in the broth. Heat in microwave until quite hot. Let sit for ten minutes. Remove mushrooms, chop finely, and set mushrooms aside. Add the ketchup and the Worcestershire to the broth. Set aside.
  </li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
  <li>
    Put 1 cup of water in pressure cooker. Put in steamer basket and cook potatoes for 6 minutes on high (quick release). Mash with onion powder, eggs, mustard, lowfat sour cream, chopped porcinis and cheddar. Set aside.
  </li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
  <li>
    Add a bit more water to pressure cooker. Pressure cook carrots and peas over steamer basket for 1 minute on high (quick release). Set aside.
  </li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
  <li>
    Heat the butter. Add the asafetida and let blend. Add the shallots and mushrooms and cook until sautéed. Add the quorn and let cook until brown. Add the flour and cook 1 minute, stirring frequently. Add the porcini-infused broth mixture gradually.
  </li>
</ol>

<ol start="6">
  <li>
    Layer the “meat” mixture, then the peas and carrots, then the mashed potatoes in a casserole. Bake for 30 minutes at 375F.
  </li>
</ol>
