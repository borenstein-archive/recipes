  * ¼ cup garbanzo flour
  * ¼ cup nutritional yeast
  * ¾ cup vital wheat gluten
  * ¼ cup red lentils

<u></u>Prepare and use as you would any seitan, mixing with water (or something else) until a rubbery dough forms, then kneading and simmering, etc. Needs a very long simmer—about 1.5 hours or more.
