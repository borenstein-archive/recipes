This slow-cooker recipe works well with many stewing meats, so long as they are rich enough not to dry out. Short ribs and their boneless counterpart (known in Yiddish as <span style="font-style: italic;">flanken</span>) are far and away the most impressive, but a shoulder chuck roast will hold up pretty well, too.

The single most important seasoning here is cloves; this cannot be omitted.

But as I think I mentioned in an earlier post, the real secret ingredient in sweet red sauces for beef in Yiddish-American cooking is soda: cola for dark sauces, and ginger ale for light ones. I have also experimented with cranberry and orange juices to good effect. (Orange juice ends up tasting like <span style="font-style: italic;">tzimmes</span>.)

It&#8217;s impossible to provide proportions here as it is completely a matter of personal preference. Since the sauce contains no raw meat, you can taste it until it &#8220;seems right&#8221;&#8211;and remember, of course, that it will be made far richer and milder by stewing with the beef.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS (SAUCE):<br /></span> 

  * 1 can (6 oz.) tomato paste 
  * Plenty of molasses
  * Ground cloves (this is <span style="font-weight: bold;">essential</span>)
  * Spicy brown mustard 
  * Cider vinegar 
  * Chopped garlic 
  * Allspice 
  * Nutmeg 
  * A little cola or ginger ale 
  * Salt 

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS (BRAISE):<br /></span> 

  * 4 beef short ribs <span style="font-style: italic;">&#8211;or&#8211;</span> 2-3 lbs. flanken or shoulder chuck roast
  * 2-3 russet potatoes, peeled and sliced
  * 1 onion, sliced

Arrange the potatoes at the bottom of the pot, followed by the onions, and then the short ribs, then apply the sauce to the top of the ribs. It will drip down as it cooks, so don&#8217;t worry too much about spreading it around. It&#8217;s OK to put some ribs on top of others; if you do that, put some sauce on top of the first layer before putting the second layer on. Cook in the slow cooker for 8-10 hours on low. Serve warm with <span style="font-style: italic;">kashe</span> or rice.
