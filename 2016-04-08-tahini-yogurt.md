This is based on the sauce from a recipe in Yotam Ottolenghi&#8217;s [Plenty](http://www.amazon.com/Plenty-Vibrant-Vegetable-Recipes-Ottolenghi/dp/1452101248). It tastes a bit like hummus, but is higher in protein adn probably lower in fat. The original definitely had too much salt. It might still have too much salt. I used garlic powder because I was out of garlic, and I actually kind of prefer it here, asÂ it lacks the harsh afterglow.

  * 1 cup Greek 2% yogurt
  * Juice of 2 lemons
  * 5 tbsp tahini
  * Quite a bit of garlic powder (measure next time)
  * 1/2 tsp salt

Combine all ingredients thoroughly in a bowl.
