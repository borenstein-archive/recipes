_I was trying to replicate the amazing mushrooms in the portobello banh mi at [Num Pang Sandwich Shop](https://www.yelp.com/biz/num-pang-sandwich-shop-new-york-4). According to their menu, they use a beet vinaigrette. I couldn&#8217;t find a recipe for mushrooms in beet vinaigrette, so I looked at a few recipes for salmon and chicken vinaigrette. These tended to call for for both the liquid and solid from steamed beets. I only had the solid, because I steam and freeze beets to have on hand. So I made a beet vinaigrette rub. Rubbing it in was a pretty satisfying, meaty experience._

_These were REALLY GOOD. The only thing I&#8217;d change is to make a lot more of them. I would definitely make banh mi with them next time, as well&#8211;put them on french bread with lightly pickled carrots, fresh cilantro, cucumber slices, and homemade mayo._

_For the banh mi, it might also be a good idea to cut tempeh so that it&#8217;s half as thick as normal, grill it over direct heat with barbecue sauce. Then serve it with all those other things on fresh French bread._

Beet rub:

  * 8 oz steamed beets (TJ sells precooked beets)
  * Juice + zest of one lemon
  * ~3 tbsp red vinegar (I used homemade, which is much stronger)
  * 2 tbsp olive oil
  * 4 cloves garlic
  * ~ 1/2 tbsp honey dijon mustard (again, homemade)
  * 1/2 tsp salt
  * 1/2 tbsp molasses
  * Drop of high-quality liquid smoke (not sure if this was a good idea)

Mushrooms:

  * 5 large portobello mushrooms, gilled, scrubbed and trimmed

Blend all of the rub ingredients in the blender until roughly smooth. On a vitamix, you have to do it on pretty low&#8211;2 or 3 at most. Place mushrooms in a bowl with rub. Massage rub into mushrooms. You should be able to get pretty much all the rub into the mushrooms, so that almost none is left. Place the mixture into a zip-loc bag and let marinate for a 24-36 hours.

Grill the mushrooms over medium direct heat, turning frequently so they don&#8217;t burn. Cook until they&#8217;ve shrunk quite a bit, by which time they should be a good deal drier but still moist.
