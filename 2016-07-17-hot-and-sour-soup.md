Adapted from [this non-vegetarian recipe from The Kitchn](http://www.thekitchn.com/recipe-hot-sour-soup-weeknight-dinner-recipes-from-the-kitchn-97281).

  * 8 cups mushroom stock (I made this from boiling old mushroom stocks)
  * 1 package tofu, cut into 1/2&#8243; x 1/2&#8243; x 2&#8243; sticks
  * 5 oz enoki mushrooms, roughly cut apart
  * 8 oz baby corn
  * Two 4&#8243; x 2&#8243;Â pieces of kelp (kombu), briefly rinsed
  * 2-4 tbsp low-sodium soy sauce
  * 4-6 tbsp rice vinegar (see below)
  * 1 can sliced bamboo shoots, drained
  * 3 eggs, beaten
  * 3 tbsp cornstarch mixed with 4 tbsp water
  * 2 tbsp dark sesame oil
  * 2 tbsp olive oil
  * White pepper (NO SUBSTITUTIONS)

Heat the sesame and olive oil in a wide soup pot. Sautee the enoki mushrooms for several minutes until wilted, then add the bamboo shoots, tofu, kombu, and baby corn until the corn is somewhat sweated.

Add the broth, rice vinegar, soy sauce, and some white pepper. Allow to come to simmer until corn is heated through. Stir in the cornstarch mixture, then whisk in the eggs.

If you add the eggs over low-medium heat, you can get a custard like Greek [avgolemono](http://www.davidbruceborenstein.com/vegepedia//2007/11/18/greek-lemon-chicken-soup/). In that case, you might want to go for the higher end of the vinegar. If you want something more like you get at a Chinese restaurant, add the eggs over a high temperature and shoot for the lower end of the vinegar range.
