_Adapted from Sandorkraut’s awesome corn relish:_

[_http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/08/ferment/?_r=0_](http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/08/ferment/?_r=0)

_ _

_I actually made the corn relish more or less verbatim (modulo a starter culture from a previous pickle batch, which makes everything easier), and LOVED it and devoured it._

_ _

400g sweet red pepper, chopped

1 large red onion, diced

1 apple or crisp pear, peeled and finely chopped

1 1/3 cup crinkle-cut carrots (OK to put in still frozen)

1 1/3 cup TJ fire roasted corn (ditto)

2 tsp salt

¼ cup reserved liquid from a previous vegetable ferment

&nbsp;

Combine everything in a large bowl. Combine and squeeze for a minute or two to bruise all the vegetables. Stuff into a ½ gallon jar with a gas lock. Ready in about 2 days—don’t let it go too long or it will stop being sweet. Refrigerate once fermented enough.
