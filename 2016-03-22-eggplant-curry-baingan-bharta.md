(adapted from: <http://konkanicravings.blogspot.com/2012/09/baingan-bharta-eggplant-curry.html>)

  * 3 large European eggplants
  * 3-4 roasted tomatoes (separate recipe &#8212; roasted in halves with olive oil)
  * Head of garlic
  * Kala namak salt
  * 1 tbsp asafetida
  * 2 tsp mustard seeds (I used brown &#8212; might prefer smaller, such as oriental or black)
  * 1 tsp cumin seeds
  * 1 tsp red pepper flakes
  * ~1/2 tbsp mango powder (did not measure)
  * ~1 tsp madras curry powder (did not measure)
  * 2 large onions
  * Handful of cilantro, chopped extremely fine
  * Olive oil

Preheat oven to 450F. Trim the stem off the eggplants and cut in half lengthwise. Rub oil on open side. Put a sheet of aluminum foil on a baking sheet. Place eggplants cut side down on baking sheet. (Use a second one if necessary). Roast until the eggplants feel kind of hollow and the skin is wrinkled, about 30 minutes depending on size. This would be even better with eggplant roasted over the grill, perhaps smoked.

Chop the onions very fine. Grind the garlic to a paste with kala namak salt.

When eggplant is done, scrape out inside, reserving skin. Remove any burned skin and then chop the remaining skin very finely. Combine the skin with the tomatoes and eggplant flesh and set aside.

Mix the asafetida, red pepper flakes, cumin seeds, and mustard seeds. In a large, wide saucepan, heat ~1/4 cup olive oil to med-high. Pour spices into oil and reduce heat to low. Stir to immerse, then cover, shaking gently, while the mustard seeds pop. Stir quickly when the popping slows, being careful not to get burned!

When popping has stopped, add garlic and scrape constantly until just beginning to change color. Add onions and sautee until golden. Add everything except the cilantro and stew over medium heat, scraping occasionally. When just about done, add the cilantro. Serve or refrigerate. If serving the next day, reheat the same way.
