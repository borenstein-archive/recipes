Back in Boston, some friends and I bought a bottle of Kübler absinthe and had a mad tea party. I made crumpets and we played diplomacy, and we finished the whole bottle. I remembered it as incredibly delicious, and then I didn&#8217;t have absinthe again for years.

When I did finally buy a bottle of absinthe in Princeton, it was Pernod&#8211;that was the only thing they carried in the store. It didn&#8217;t seem as delicious as I remembered, but memory can do that, so I wrote it off as nostalgia.

Now that I&#8217;m going into NYC every week, I was able to track down a bottle of Kübler. Before polishing off the Pernod, I decided to put them next to each other. What followed was an exceptional demonstration of &#8220;You get what you pay for.&#8221;

**Price:**

Pernod = $29, Kubler = $66.

**Color:**

The Pernod is roughly the color of [antifreeze](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/16/Antifreeze_in_the_radiator.jpg), care of the FD&C yellow #5. The Kübler is completely clear, and the only thing that distinguishes it from vodka in appearance is its viscosity. I seem to recall cachaça as having a similar appearance.

**Scent:**

The first thing that you smell with Pernod is rubbing alcohol. It&#8217;s like the smell of cheap vodka, but then it&#8217;s followed by the lingering smell of peppermint and licorice candy. Kübler smells sweet and soft, with a strong vegetal licorice, almost like a blend of licorice root and freshly cut grass. HK thought that the licorice smell was stronger in the Pernod. She also smelled alcohol in the Pernod, but it wasn&#8217;t harsh.

**Taste**:

The Pernod was a very harsh sip&#8211;very hard to drink without water. Once you regained your senses, the taste was very sweet, with a strong licorice candy note. It tasted a lot like an alcohol version of Good n&#8217; Plenty candy. The Kübler was spicy, but surprisingly smooth. There was no impulse to do anything but swoosh it around and then swallow.

I had thought that this sense of smoothness was because I tasted it second, but I got new evidence on that. HK tasted the Kübler first, and she looked reflective and calm. When she tasted the Pernod, she literally gagged. (I should mention that she had them with water. I had them both ways.)

Anyway: the Kübler was not sweet at all, despite its scent. It was a much more distinctive taste, much less licorice than the Pernod.

The way I had described it all those years ago was that Kübler is to NyQuil as actual oranges are to orange cough syrup. I believe that this is still a good description. Orange cough syrup is not a pleasant taste, but you can recognize the relationship to the bright, refreshing taste of real oranges. Likewise, Kübler is the original taste from which the medicine NyQuil is the bizarre, xerox-of-a-xerox derivative.

**Conclusion:** 

Pernod is fine for mixed drinks. Indeed, it seems a waste to throw away Kübler on a cocktail when it is so magnificent on its own. As an absinthe, though&#8211;to be enjoyed with just a splash of water&#8211;I don&#8217;t see how I could ever go back.
