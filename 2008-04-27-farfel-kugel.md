A <span style="font-style: italic;">kugel</span> is a pudding or casserole, and while there are many different kinds of kugels, I generally divide them into two categories: sweet and savory. This kugel, made from matzo farfel (crumbled matzo), is a lot like bread pudding, except richer.

The traditional place of a dairy kugel like this one is on Saturday (<span style="font-style: italic;">shabbat</span>) morning brunch; you could also serve it for any breakfast. Traditionally, it would not be served with or after a meat meal because eating milk after meat is prohibited. However, if you do not keep kosher, this makes a fine dessert.

By soaking the matzo farfel before using it, it mostly disintegrates and gives the kugel a smooth, pudding-like texture. I plan on posting another variation on farfel kugel that seeks to keep the matzo somewhat more intact.

I got this recipe from my mother, who got it from <span style="font-style: italic;">The Jewish Home Cookbook</span>. I have made a couple of substitutions (in parentheses) to bring it from &#8216;inconceivably high fat&#8217; to merely &#8216;very high fat.&#8217; Mmmm&#8230;.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 3 cup matzo farfel (or whole matzo crumbled into small pieces)
  * 3/4 cup butter
  * 5 eggs
  * 3/4 cup sugar
  * 1/2 tsp. salt
  * 8 tbsp. cottage cheese
  * 4 tbsp. (lowfat) sour cream
  * 8 oz. (light) cream cheese
  * 3/4 cup golden raisins
  * 1 cup milk
  * 1 tsp. vanilla
  * 2 tsp. cinnamon

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees; boil some water.
  2. Combine matzo farfel and raisins in a bowl.
  3. Cover farfel and raisin mixture with boiling water and let stand 15 minutes; then drain in a colander.
  4. Meanwhile, beat eggs and then add sugar, salt, cottage cheese, sour cream and cream cheese, combining thoroughly. (Use a blender for this if you prefer.)
  5. Melt the butter and combine with the matzo farfel so that it is coated. Then add the egg mixture and combine. Transfer the mixture to a buttered, nonstick baking pan or casserole.
  6. Scald the milk in a saucepan, then pour it evenly over the kugel. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Do not mix.</span>
  7. Bake for 30 minutes at 400 degrees, then another 20 minutes at 350 degrees.

Allow to cool slightly before serving. Makes great leftovers.
