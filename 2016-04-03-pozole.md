_Cilantro would have been good, but I didn’t have it. Chipotles en adobo would have been good, but I didn’t think of it. Honestly, it’s easy to forget this doesn’t have meat in it._

  * 1 can golden hominy, drained
  * 1 can white hominy, drained
  * 2/3 package Wegman’s “don’t be piggy” crumbles
  * 1 package quorn crumbles
  * 1 can whole tomatillos, drained and roughly pureed
  * 1 bell pepper (I had frozen), diced
  * 1 large onion, diced
  * Several cloves garlic
  * ¼ cup olive oil
  * Juice of two limes
  * Zest of one lime
  * Asafetida
  * Cumin
  * Paprika
  * Cayenne

Steam the peppers—microwave is fine. Heat the oil in a large flat pot. Add asafetida and cumin. Add all crumbles and let cook a bit. Add onions, peppers, and garlic. Cook, covered, stirring frequently, until it’s all soft and looks delicious. Add everything else except cayenne and paprika. If I had been using chipotles (and I should have) I would have chopped one up and added it here. Let cook for several minutes covered on low. Uncover and add paprika, cayenne and salt to taste&#8211;maybe also more lime or lemon juice. If I were using cilantro, I’d add it at the end, after the stew was done.
