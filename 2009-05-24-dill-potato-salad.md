This is an update on the [spicy mustard potato salad](http://tofuvavohu.blogspot.com/2007/12/spicy-mustard-potato-salad.html), and I think this time I got it where I want to be. The sauce on these is a lively shade of spring green, so garnish with red onion rings and whole dill.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:</span> 

  * 3-4 lbs red potatoes
  * 1/2 medium red onion, finely diced
  * 3/4 cup coarsely ground mustard
  * 1/2 cup spicy brown mustard
  * 1 bunch dill, stems removed (divided use)
  * 1 shallot, peeled
  * 1/3 cup cider vinegar
  * 1/4 cup olive oil

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Boil the potatoes, skin-on, until tender but not too soft, about 20 minutes. Allow to cool to room temperature, about 1 hour.
  2. Cut the potatoes into 3/4&#8243; cubes and place in a mixing bowl with the onions. Set aside.
  3. Put the mustards, oil, vinegar, shallot and half the dill into a food processor. Puree until quite smooth.
  4. <span style="font-weight: bold;">A little at a time, </span>gently mix the dressing into the potatoes, tasting as you go, until the desired intensity is reached.
  5. Transfer to a serving dish, garnishing with the remainder of the dill.

Best if served at room temperature.
