These are based on the cranberry-chocolate-coconut muffins that I made a few weeks ago. They came out quite well. They need to be made a bit darker than other waffles to get a good crisp. As with all psyllium waffles, add the psyllium after all other ingredients (except chocolate chips, if using).

  * 180g white flour
  * 180g oat bran
  * 40g Jarrow whey protein
  * 1 tbsp baking powder
  * 1/4 tsp salt
  * 500g fresh (or frozen) cranberries
  * 180g fage (what I had)
  * 1/2 cup buttermilk
  * 1/4 cup butter
  * 1/2 cup egg white
  * 30g molasses
  * 25 drops stevia
  * 1 tbsp homemade vanilla
  * 1/2 tbsp rum seconds vanilla paste
  * 60g mini chocolate chips
  * 2 tbsp psyllium
