This is simply my favorite main course to make in the whole world. Period. It is very loosely based on a recipe by the same name from <span style="font-style: italic;">The Silver Palate Cookbook</span>, although I haven&#8217;t seen the original recipe in three years, so it&#8217;s probably nothing like it.

Anyways, this is the most delicious thing ever. And it&#8217;s really easy to make. And it&#8217;s wonderful left over.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS</span>

To marinate the chicken <span style="font-weight: bold;">(24 hours in advance)</span>: 

  * 3 lbs. boneless, skinless chicken thighs
  * 10 oz. dried fruit (prunes and apricots are good)
  * 8 oz. (1/2 jar) green olives, <span style="font-weight: bold;">with juice</span>
  * 2 oz. capers, with a little bit of juice (not all of it)
  * Garlic, minced (I use about 8 cloves worth)
  * 3 tbsp. za&#8217;atar or oregano
  * 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar
  * 1/4 cup olive oil
  * 6 bay leaves
  * Dash of lemon juice
  * Plenty of fresh black pepper

For cooking: 

  * 1/2 cup light brown sugar
  * 1/2 cup white wine
  * Toasted almond slices (optional)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:</span> 

  1. Combine all the ingredients from the &#8220;marinating&#8221; section above (that is, everything but the brown sugar, white wine and almonds) in a big container and mix it all up. Cover and refrigerate for 24 hours.
  2. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The next day</span>, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
  3. Lay out the chicken pieces in a single layer in a baking dish. Spread the marinade (with the olives, fruit, etc.) evenly over the chicken.
  4. Sprinkle the brown sugar and almond slices over the chicken.
  5. Sprinkle the white wine over the chicken, so it moistens the brown sugar.
  6. Bake for about 40 minutes, basting occasionally. You can tell it&#8217;s done when you poke one of the chicken thighs and the juice that comes out is golden colored.

Serve with white rice. Makes a great leftover.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">PAIRINGS:<br /><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span></span>A more skillful sommelier would probably disagree with me, but I think that this can be done with either a bright, fruity red or a crisp white. The main thing is that you want a wine that&#8217;s a bit tart, to play off the herbs and the sweetness of the dish. I&#8217;ve also done this with a hefeweizen, but I really think wine is the better choice.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span></span>
