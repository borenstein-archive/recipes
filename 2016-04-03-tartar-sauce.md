_I basically followed this recipe, except I used about 2/3 lowfat sour cream and 1/3 mayonnaise: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tartar-sauce-recipe4.html_

_I used Bubbe’s relish. I squeezed it out before adding it._

_We’ve both been mixing the tartar and horseradish sauces, so I probably ought to make one recipe that combines them both._
