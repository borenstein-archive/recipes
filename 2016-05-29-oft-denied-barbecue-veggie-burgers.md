I make veggie burgers all the time, but I always forget to measure. When I finally tried to do so, things started going wrong. The first time, I used a really gross cheese that gave the whole batch a bad taste. The second time, right as I was finishing, the cap fell off the salt and a pound of salt fell into the veggie burgers. The third time, the beans all fell on the floor. Finally, I got one batch that nothing bad happened to.

**Variation 1: plain**

  * 1 medium Vidalia onion, finely chopped
  * 3-4 oz sharp cheddar
  * 1 large can Goya low-sodium black beans
  * 1/2 cup plain bread crumbs (panko works well)
  * 1/2 cup oat bran
  * 120g ketchup
  * ~1 tsp barbecue spice blends from Savory Spice Shop (I often mix a couple&#8211;depends on the mood)
  * ~1 tbsp molasses

**Variation 2: veggie**

  * 1/2 medium Vidalia onion, finely chopped
  * 1 large green pepper, diced
  * Handful of fresh spinach leaves, finely chopped
  * 3-4 oz sharp cheddar
  * 1 large can Goya low-sodium black beans
  * 1/2 cup plain bread crumbs (panko works well)
  * 1/2 cup oat bran
  * 120g ketchup
  * ~1 tsp barbecue spice blends from Savory Spice Shop (I often mix a couple&#8211;depends on the mood)
  * ~1 tbsp molasses

If using green pepper, microwave for ~5 minutes on high, until it&#8217;s falling-apart overcooked. Combine all ingredients in a bowl, squeezing with hands to mush together. Form into patties for cooking. May be frozen as patties.
