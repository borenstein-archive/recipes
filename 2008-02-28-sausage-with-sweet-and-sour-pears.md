Another gem from Rafael Pereira&#8217;s tapas class. This has some of the fruit-and-wine flavors of sangria in a food context. This is a fine example of the kinds of foods that keep me from ever going strictly kosher. However, I think that this could be kosher-ified by replacing the sausage with a spicy beef meatball.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">UPDATE 4/26/08: </span>I tried this with apples and it was still quite tasty. Use crisp apples. Also, a clarification: do not peel the fruit. Finally, a thickener such as cornstarch is recommended. I have updated the recipe to reflect all three of these things.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">UPDATE 6/29/08:</span> I tried this with peaches and chourizo. Very delicious. Use somewhat under-ripe peaches so that they hold their shape. Also, when using a softer sausage like chourizo, consider cooking it in larger pieces and then cutting it into diagonals. This way, it will hold the shape that you cut much better.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 1 1/2 lbs (1 package) linguica, sliced 30 degrees askew into 1/4&#8243; slices
  * 1 cup sugar if using dry wine, or 1/2 cup sugar if using sweet wine
  * 1 cup red wine vinegar (or 3/4 cup white vinegar and 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar)
  * 1 cup red wine (if using sweet wine, reduce the amount of sugar)
  * 1 cinnamon stick
  * 4 pears (Rafael used green; I prefer Bosc or Asian) or crisp apples, cored and cut up (not peeled)
  * 1 tbsp. cornstarch<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br /></span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Combine the sugar, vinegar, wine and cinnamon in a saucepan.
  2. Bring to a boil and let simmer, uncovered, for 5 minutes.
  3. Add pears and let simmer, covered, for 20 more minutes.
  4. Let this mixture sit out (at room temperature) overnight.
  5. <span style="font-weight: bold;">THE NEXT DAY</span>, remove the pairs from the sauce and set aside.
  6. Bring the sauce to a simmer; add the linguica and simmer gently for 10 minutes.
  7. Remove the linguica to the container with the apples, keeping the liquid in the saucepan.
  8. Stir the cornstarch into two tablespoons of water (or wine or vinegar, if you prefer), then stir this mixture into the sauce. Allow to thicken for a couple of minutes at low heat, stirring occasionally.
  9. Pour the sauce over the linguica and apples and serve.
