This is trivially easy and, if you have a sourdough starter, pretty close to free. Adapted from [this thread](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/3944/pita-help) on &#8220;The Fresh Loaf,&#8221; which got it from [Randy&#8217;s Vegetarian Cookbook](http://www.nanday.com/cookbook/45.php). Use a 475° oven for pocketless pitas. Roll thinner and raise oven to maximum temp for pitas with pockets.

Makes 3-4 pitas. Double or triple as needed.

  Variation: this recipe produces a deep, moist pita, more like what is found in Greek restaurants. For a rustic, &#8220;desert&#8221; pita, leave out the water and add substantially less flour at the end. Roll into much thinner pitas&#8211;say, 1/8&#8243; thick&#8211;and bake for no more than 3m 30s. Note that kneading such a dough is much more physically demanding.

  Notes: if making several batches at once, do not roll out each loaf until immediately before you put it in the oven. Also, cover unrolled balls with a damp cloth to prevent them from drying out.

  <span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS</span>: 
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      1/2 cup sourdough starter
    </li>
    <li>
      1/4 cup water
    </li>
    <li>
      1 1/2 tsp sugar
    </li>
    <li>
      1/2 tsp salt
    </li>
    <li>
      1 1/2 cups flour (divided use)
    </li>
  </ul>

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">RECIPE:<br /></span> 
    
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, mix sourdough starter, water, sugar and 1/2 cup flour. Add salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead in another 1/2 cup flour. Knead for 5-10 minutes or until the dough forms a springy, cohesive ball. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise for 45-60 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Knead in more flour until you have a firm, but still pliable dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut into 3-4 equal pieces. Roll into balls and let rest for 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 500°. While the oven is heating, roll the balls into 1/4&#8243; sheets. (Do not roll any thinner than 1/4&#8243;.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for about 5 minutes, or until the pitas suddenly puff up. (They will collapse again once you remove them from heat.)
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>
      If eating that day, let cool for a moment then serve immediately. Otherwise, allow to reach room temperature, then freeze in an airtight container or bag.
