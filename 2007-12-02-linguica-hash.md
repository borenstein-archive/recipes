This zesty hash is about the most welcome sight imaginable on a cold Sunday morning. Plan to have this the day after the beet salad, since the hash is made almost entirely from leftover ingredients for that.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * (Leftover) boiled potatoes, cubed
  * Red onion, minced
  * Cooked linguica, minced
  * Just a pinch of flour (to hold it together)
  * Worcestershire sauce
  * Hot sauce (such as Tabasco or Frank&#8217;s Red Hot)
  * Olive oil

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Cook the linguica if it&#8217;s not already cooked. Cutting it in half and pan-frying it for a few minutes is the easiest way.
  2. Combine the potatoes, onion, linguica, flour, a bit of oil and the two sauces in a bowl.
  3. Pre-heat a skillet until it is SCORCHING hot. Spray with cooking spray or a bit of oil to prevent sticking if necessary.
  4. Spread out your hash in an even layer across the skillet and let it crisp on the bottom.
  5. Flip over the pancake and brown the other side briefly.

Obviously, you&#8217;ll want to eat this with some eggs and good, strong coffee. After that, you should sit around in your pyjamas and read &#8220;The Economist&#8221; for about five hours.
