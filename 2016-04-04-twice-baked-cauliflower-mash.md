_First time I made this, I used a 350F oven, which was too low. I’m going to try 375 next time._

  * 1 large head cauliflower (I’d guess 1.5-2 lb), broken into florets
  * 2 large Spanish onions, diced
  * 1 lb lowfat sour cream
  * ¼ cup low-end parmesan
  * 1 tbsp coarse Dijon mustard
  * 6-8 cloves garlic, chopped
  * ¼ cup olive oil
  * 5 large eggs
  * ½ cup egg white
  * 2 tbsp flour
  * ½ cup plain breadcrumbs
  * High quality parmesan (or other cheese) for garnish
  * 1 tsp asafetida
  * Salt and pepper to taste

Steam or boil the cauliflower until soft. If you wish, you can do this in vegetable broth, but be aware that the broth picks up a taste that some (HK) do not like.

Grind the cauliflower in a food processor. Set aside. Preparing the cauliflower may be done the day before.

Preheat oven to 375F.

Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the asafetida and allow to dissolve, stirring constantly. Add the onions and garlic. Caramelize until golden brown.

Add the onion mixture to the pureed cauliflower. Add all other ingredients except garnish. Transfer to a casserole dish.

Grate high-quality cheese over mixture. Cover with foil and bake in oven for 60 minutes. Increase heat to 425. Bake for 30 minutes more.
