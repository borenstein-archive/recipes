Here is the original recipe: <http://www.cookingchanneltv.com/recipes/kelsey-nixon/vanilla-almonds.html>

**INGREDIENTS:**

  * 1 tsp vanilla
  * 1 egg white
  * 2/3 cup sugar in the raw
  * 4 cups whole almonds
  * 1/4 tsp salt
  * 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon

**DIRECTIONS:**

  1. Preheat oven to 300 degrees.
  2. Grease my large baking sheet with a buttery spread (e.g., Olivio)
  3. Crack 1 egg white in my medium silver bowl. Add 1 tsp of 2x Pure Madagascar vanilla extract. Beat together. Mix in the almonds.
  4. In a separate bowl, combine 2/3 sugar in the raw (or, less good, ¾ sucanat), ½ tsp ground cinnamon, ¼ tsp salt.
  5. Pour the dry mixture into the almond mixture and stir to make sure everything is coated.
  6. Pour it onto the baking sheet and press down with a fork so that it is a single layer. It fits the baking sheet exactly. There might be some liquid left over &#8212; don’t pour it onto the almonds, just discard.
  7. Bake in oven (bottom shelf) for 20 minutes.
  8. Scrape them off the pan and onto wax paper. They will seem too wet, but don’t worry, they will dry.
