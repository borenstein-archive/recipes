I don&#8217;t know why I didn&#8217;t think to make notes last year, but there are definitely insights to be gained by keeping track of what happens grilling.

I tried direct heat (lid off, lots of coals) for the first time today. I lit a chimney of &#8220;competition grade&#8221; briquettes and then poured them over unlit briquettes. The unlit briquettes kind of caught all at once after about 15 minutes, and it went from way too cool to pretty damned hot all at once.

I made the beet-rubbed mushrooms, some tempeh slathered with barbecue sauce and some corn. I also did three apples in packets, buried in the coals.

  * For the corn, I first shucked it and soaked it for about 15 minutes&#8211;about the time that it took for the chimney to get ready. I turned them nearly constantly. They came out great.
  * For the apples, I carved out a cone at the stem end and stuffed them with cinnamon sticks and dried apricots. One of them burnt to a crisp, the others came out beautifully baked. I think you might need a lot of layers of foil and fairly big apples. HK strongly prefers pears to apples. I&#8217;m also not sure yet if she strongly prefers the above-the-grate approach to the in-coals approach, which more concentrates the flavors but also burns part of the fruit.
  * For the mushrooms, see the separate recipe.
  * For the tempeh, I really like the outside, where the sauce gets burnt on. But the middle is bland. So next time, carefully, cut them so that they&#8217;re half as thick, and put sauce on both sides, cooking over direct heat.
