I love buffalo chicken with bleu cheese sauce, but I always feel like that sauce is needlessly heavy and insipid. Then, in early 2007, I was at the Stonewall Kitchen store in Maine, and I discovered their [Blue Cheese Herb Mustard](http://www.stonewallkitchen.com/prdsell.aspx?L0=specialtyfoods&L1=Mustards&L2=BlueCheeseHerbMustard). This is an excellent product, but&#8211;you know me and processed food&#8211;I wanted to make it myself.

I experimented with gorgonzola, which was way too sharp and not creamy enough. Then I turned to roquefort, and it provided a beautiful smoothness whose pungency played right off that of the mustard. It screamed out for tarragon, and that was that. Try this on your buffalo wings; I promise you won&#8217;t be disappointed.
