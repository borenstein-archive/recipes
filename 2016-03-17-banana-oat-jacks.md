**INGREDIENTS:**

  * 0.75 cup quick cooking oats
  * 1 cup cottage cheese
  * 0.75 cup egg white
  * 2 capfuls of 2x vanilla
  * 1 1/2 large bananas
  * Pinch of salt
  * Teaspoon of baking powder
  * Butter (see below)

**DIRECTIONS:**

  1. Blend thoroughly.
  2. Preheat big super nonstick skillet to medium (on the power burner).
  3. Coat with just enough butter to prevent sticking (or they will stick, even on the NS pan). With butter, they won&#8217;t form bubbles &#8212; flip when you think they&#8217;re ready. (Takes some practice.)
  4. Keep warm by trapping between plates; serve immediately.
