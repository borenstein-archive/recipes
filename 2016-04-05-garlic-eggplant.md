_I have now eliminated yet another reason to go to restaurants. No need to adhere to precise measurements; I just wanted to start off accurate._

**INGREDIENTS**

  * 1850g eggplant (variety doesn’t matter)
  * 4 tbsp olive oil, divided use
  * 8 tbsp reduced sodium soy sauce
  * 5 tbsp sugar
  * 1 tbsp cornstarch
  * 2 cups water
  * 4 large cloves garlic
  * ½ head black garlic
  * 2 tbsp garlic granules
  * ½ tbsp. asafetida
  * 1 tsp Aleppo chiles

**PROCEDURE**

  1. If using European eggplant or other wide eggplants, cut lengthwise into quarters and then slice into 1” triangles. For thin eggplants, cut into 1” semicircles.
  2. In a mortar and pestle, combine the asafetida, Aleppo chiles, garlic granules, fresh garlic, and black garlic with enough of the olive oil to allow it to blend.
  3. In a wok or other wide, heavy-bottomed pan, heat the remaining oil. When hot, add the garlic mixture and reduce heat to medium. Cook until all the oil is absorbed.
  4. Add the eggplant and the water. Increase to high, cover, and heat for two minutes. Stir, cover, and heat for two more minutes. Repeat, stirring increasingly frequently, until the water is totally absorbed.
  5. Meanwhile, combine the sugar, cornstarch and soy sauce.
  6. When the eggplant is has absorbed all the water and has sautéed to the desired level of falling-apartness, add the cornstarch mixture. Heat until the cornstarch has thickened, 1-2 minutes.
  7. Serve with Mori-nu tofu, rice, broccoli, avocado, etc. Sprinkle with peanuts and/or scallions.
