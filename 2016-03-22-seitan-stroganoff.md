I unfortunately didn’t write exactly what I did here in time, but I will describe what to do next. Write down proportions next time! Plan to use most of a bottle of white wine.

Start with this seitan recipe:

<http://www.thewickedgoodvegan.com/2011/11/15/homemade-seitan/>

I might try adding parmesan (and melted butter?) directly to the batter. Then simmer it, in slices, in a simmering liquid of veg broth, about 1/3 bottle white wine, tamari, saffron, and dried porcinis.

Chop up an onion. When the seitan is done cooking, remove the cutlets and sear them on a hot pan, then set aside. Meanwhile, cut up the porcinis and set aside. In another pot, heat some butter and olive oil (50/50) and add some asafetida when it’s hot. Sautee the onion until golden, then add flour a bit and cook until you have a brown slurry. Add the rest of the white wine, a bit at a time, and deglaze the pan. Then add the porcinis and begin adding the cooking liquid in as well. Stir in some coarse prepared mustard. (I think this should probably be made from 100% yellow mustard seed—brown and black are too spicy for this.)
