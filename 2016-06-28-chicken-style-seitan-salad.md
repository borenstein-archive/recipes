_Update: I guess we didn&#8217;t actually like this that much, because we didn&#8217;t finish it. The egg-style tofu salad is better. For chicken salad, try Moshe&#8217;s vegetarian chicken salad, which is what I was trying to replicate and which is really excellent. So far, I have only ever seen it in a tub at the Whole Earth Center in Princeton. I have also seen it in a prepackaged sandwich at Whole Foods._

Might want to consider using the food processor to chop the seitan next time.

  * 1 package (12 oz) Ray&#8217;s &#8220;wheat meat&#8221; seitan, drained
  * 4 tbsp lowfat sour cream
  * 1 tbsp dijon mustard
  * 2 tsp mayonnaise
  * 2 tbsp drained relish
  * 1 tsp lemon juice
  * Freshly ground pepper

Finely mince the wheat meat and dry it. I did this by placing a paper towel over a clean hand towel over a plate, then reversing the sequence above. Combine all ingredients in a bowl. Use like chicken salad.
