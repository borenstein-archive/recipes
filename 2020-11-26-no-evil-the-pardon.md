# Notes on preparing ["The Pardon" by No Evil foods](https://www.noevilfoods.com/products/the-pardon/)

The packaging for this roast emphasizes the need to prepare a gravy, and they're not kidding. The outside is absolutely encrusted with stuffing-flavored herbs. Coupled with [a good gravy](2020-11-26-mushroom-gravy.md), the whole concoction tastes closer to a traditional Thanskgiving meal than any other vegetarian alternative to date.

That said, it's very salty and very lean (as these things usually are), and the recommended preparation of cooking it in either veg broth or white wine seems like it would have left it feeling dry and, in the case of the broth, even saltier.

What I did instead was to fry some [asafoetida powder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asafoetida) in olive oil, then fry a coarsely sliced onion in that mixture until it had developed a brown crust. I transferred this to the pan with the uncooked Pardon, then added a half cup each of water and Pacific mushroom broth. I could have skipped the mushroom broth and gone all water--it would have been fine.

The fried onions and asafoetida added fat and umami without adding salt. I cooked as directed, basting the roast after it was done and before serving it. We served this basting liquid exactly as we would have used the juice of a roasted turkey, alongside the gravy, to satisfying effect.
