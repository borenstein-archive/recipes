Adjust the proportions here according to taste; they can vary pretty widely. Mine comes out quite tart and not too sweet.

Note that applesauce requires almost no water; you just add enough to allow the apples to steam themselves into a sauce.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 4 lbs granny smith or other sour apple, peeled, cored and quartered
  * 1 lb. fresh cranberries, rinsed
  * 3 tbsp. lemon juice
  * 1/3 cup brown sugar
  * 4 cloves, whole
  * 1 tsp. ground nutmeg
  * 2 tsp. ground cinnamon
  * 1/2 tsp ground ginger
  * 1/2 cup water

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:</span>

Combine all ingredients in a slow cooker. Mix thoroughly and turn heat to low. Let cook for 8-10 hours, stirring occasionally. Mash before serving. Refrigerate unused portion.
