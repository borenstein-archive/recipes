  * ½ lb giant lima beans, dry
  * ½ lb navy beans
  * 1 ½ Spanish onions, diced
  * 5 cloves garlic, minced
  * 1 tbsp asafetida
  * ¼ cup WF Greek olive oil
  * 65g WF light brown sugar
  * 65g granulated sugar
  * 55g Wholesome Sweetners blackstrap molasses
  * 100g WF organic ketchup
  * 1 tsp Cedarhouse liquid hickory smoke
  * 1 heaping tsp SS Spanish paprika
  * 4 tbsp cider vinegar
  * 8 g + fine dusting kala namak (divided use, see below)
  * 1 tbsp Bourbon Barrel Foods vegan Worcestershire sauce
  * 2 cups water
  * 1 cup Heaven Hill bourbon
  * 60g homemade honey Dijon mustard

  1. Crushed garlic with some kala namak into a paste. Let stand.
  2. Picked over beans, washed, and put in PC. Put potliquor from previous, botched batch of beans, plus water to fill it up halfway. Added 2 tbsp olive oil. PC on high for 12 minutes, quick release. This was not enough. Did another 2 minutes + QR. This was too much for the navy beans, and just right for lima beans. (The limas weren’t supposed to be there, though.) Next time, try 12 minutes + 5 minutes passive, then QR.
  3. Heated olive oil in a wide saucepan to med-high.  Added asafetida, cooked (stirring constantly) until blended. Added garlic; cooked (stirring constantly) until changing color, turning to medium at halfway. Added onions, increased to high. Cooked as normal until well soft (would be golden, but can’t tell b/c of asafetida).
  4. Combined remaining ingredients in a bowl.
  5. Put everything into a slow cooker and gently (gently!) combined. Slow cooked on low for 7 hours and then allowed to cool before putting into containers.

Notes:

  * The white sugar and extra molasses was b/c I ran out of brown sugar. Could probably just use all white sugar and even more molasses, though.
  * HK thinks it would be better without the Lima beans.
