I picked up 100g (3.4oz) of apple molasses in Denmark at a price of about $10 (=$2.90 per ounce). Turns out this is an old New England tradition, where it is called “boiled cider.” As the name suggests, making this is a cinch—take a gallon of cider ($4) and boil it until it’s 2.5 cups (24 oz, so $0.16 per ounce). It will also make the house smell nice. This would absolutely be an authentic ingredient for the baked beans, which already have cider vinegar in them. Use it instead of sugar molasses.

**Update: did this twice, boiling it down to 1.5 cups and 2.5 cups. Much sweeter than molasses—more like honey. The 1.5 cups is, in fact, sweeter (and more dense) than table sugar; it was so thick that it was hard even to scoop it when cold, but liquefied at slightly warm temperatures. Boiling to 2.5 cups is quite manageable. I will refer to the former as 11x and the latter as 6x (rounding to nearest whole #).**
