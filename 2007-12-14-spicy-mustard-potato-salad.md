I am still tweaking this recipe to get it where I want it to be, but it&#8217;s already pretty good. Feedback is certainly welcome as I attempt to create a zingy, spicy, German-style potato salad. The intense, warm zest of the whole-grain mustard is the dominant flavor, with the brown mustard mainly serving to coat the potato pieces, so that no part of the salad is left untouched by the mustard.

Note that whole-grain mustard (with the mustardseeds intact) requires much more volume for the same amount of flavor and coverage. If you&#8217;re using anything else, make much less dressing.

If prepared without bacon, this dish can be kosher parve. (For those at my family hannukah party now reading this&#8211;don&#8217;t worry, the version I served was parve!)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 6 oz. bacon <span style="font-weight: bold;">&#8211;OR&#8211; <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span>3 tbsp. olive oil<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span><br /></span>
  * 3-4 lbs. red potatoes
  * 1/2 red onion, finely chopped
  * 2/3 cup whole-grain mustard
  * 1/4 cup spicy brown mustard (such as Goulden&#8217;s)
  * 1 tbsp. ground mustardseed
  * 1/3 cup cider vinegar
  * 1 bunch of fresh dill, finely chopped
  * 1 tbsp. freshly grated horseradish

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Boil enough water to cover potatoes. Add potatoes to boiling water and allow to cook for 20-25 minutes or until tender.
  2. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Meanwhile</span>, if you are using bacon, cook the bacon in a griddle until somewhat crispy. Set aside, reserving the grease.
  3. Once the potatoes are done cooking, cut them into 3/4&#8243; cubes.
  4. Combine mustards, horseradish, vinegar and oil or grease in a bowl and combine well. Do not puree.
  5. Put potatoes in a bowl. Crumble the bacon onto the potatoes, along with half the dill. Add the onions and dressing and gently combine.
  6. Garnish with remaining dill.

Serve warm.
