I&#8217;ve been playing around with my pressure cooker lately. This came out pretty well, but I&#8217;m still tweaking it. One thing that&#8217;s nice is that it&#8217;s absurdly easy.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:</span> 

  * 1 lb frozen halibut or other white fish, in thick chunks (do not defrost)
  * 1 can light coconut milk
  * 1 carton low-sodium vegetable broth
  * 1/2 tbsp honey
  * 2 tbsp tamari
  * 1 12-oz package of sliced mushrooms
  * Juice of 2 lemons
  * 3 cloves of garlic, crushed
  * 1 tbsp minced ginger

<span style="font-weight: bold;">RECIPE:<br /></span> 

  1. Combine all ingredients in a pressure cooker. Turn the cooker to high, and let cook for 4 minutes once pressure is reached. Use cold-water release method.

I told you it was easy.
