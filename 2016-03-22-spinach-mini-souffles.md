These were &#8220;just okay.&#8221; Included here as a reference in case I try to improve on the concept.

INGREDIENTS AS PREPARED:

  * ~6oz chard
  * ~6oz spinach
  * 1 cup 1% cottage cheese
  * 1/4 cup powdered egg white
  * 1/2 cup flour
  * 1 tsp onion powder
  * 1/4 tsp garlic powder
  * 1/4 tsp black pepper
  * 1/2 tsp baking powder (special&#8211;see below)
  * 2 tbsp olive oil
  
    35g feta
  * 4 heaping tbsp Wegman&#8217;s romano + parmesan blend

Preheat oven to 350F. Steam the greens for 1 minute. Put in the food processor and grind for several minutes, until fairly smooth. Put everything else except baking powder in food processor and grind for awhile longer. Butter a 12-muffin pan. BAKING POWDER A/B TEST:Â  Pour half the batter into six of the 12 muffin spaces. Add the baking powder to food processor, run to mix. Pour baking powder into other six. (So next time, use 2x baking powder and put it into all of them with the rest of the ingredients.) Bake for 25 minutes or until toothpick comes out clean. Let cool.

NOTES

&#8211; Baking powder souffles rose vastly more than those without. This is a net positive&#8211;use baking powder for all next time.

&#8211; These were set just a bit too much. Try backing off on the flour and egg white powder by 1tbsp each.

&#8211; Used cheeses that I had around. The result was too salty and not sharp enough. Use a salt-free cottage cheese, then use parmesan only.

&#8211; Used greens that I had around. Probably any are fine
