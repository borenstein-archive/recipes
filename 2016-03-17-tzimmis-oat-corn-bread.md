_As made, not as recommended. See notes at end._

**INGREDIENTS:**

  * 1 cup (175g) medium yellow cornmeal
  * 1 cup (120g) oat bran
  * 1/3 cup egg white
  * 1/4 cup Greek yogurt 0%
  * 10g egg white powder
  * 2 cups (260g) raw apple, peeled and grated
  * 2 cups (180g) raw carrots, peeled and grated
  * 3 cups (260g) raw sweet potato, peeled and grated
  * 1/4 cup canola oil
  * 1/4 cup (60g) white sugar
  * 1 tsp (8g) salt (yes, really &#8212; all of it)
  * 2 tsp (7g) baking powder
  * 2 tsp (10g) cinnamon
  * 1 tsp 2x vanilla

**DIRECTIONS:**

  1. preheat oven to 325.
  2. Combine wet ingredients separately from dry ingredients. mix each bowl well, then combine into one bowl and mix well.
  3. oil or grease two nonstick loaf pans really well, then pour mixture into them, smoothing out tops.
  4. Cover with foil and bake for 1 hourÂ at 325.
  5. Remove foil and bake for 15 more minutes at 350.
  6. Cool on a wire rack.

**NOTES:**

  * Too dry &#8212; remove 1/4 each of the bran and oats
  * more egg white and yogurt
  * sticks to pan with thin layer of canola, even on non-stick. May need shortening or other intense non-stick.
  * desperately wants fruit and nuts. could soak fruit in brandy briefly for a nice effect, but remember that this is breakfast! Cranberries and walnuts are obvious choices. I&#8217;d also add poppies, flax meal, etc, but be mindful of HK&#8217;s texture preferences&#8230;
  * muffins would be good..
