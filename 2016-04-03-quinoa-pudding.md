Made with what I had around. Could use all regular milk and maybe some powdered buttermilk next time. Maybe use more salt.

  * 1 tbsp pistachio extract
  * ¾ tsp SS rose water
  * 1 tbsp Madagascar B vanilla
  * 4 tbsp sugar
  * 5 cups qunioa
  * 3 1/2 cups whole milk
  * 1 cup whole milk yogurt that never set (liquid but tastes like yogurt)
  * ½ cup powdered nonfat milk
  * 1 ½ cups egg white
  * 3 large eggs
  * A shake of cinnamon
  * ½ cup raisins that have been soaking in firewater for awhile
  * 3/8 tsp salt
