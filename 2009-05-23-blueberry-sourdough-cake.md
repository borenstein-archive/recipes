Simple and refreshing. Based on [this coffee cake recipe](http://www.thriftyfun.com/tf827094.tip.html). Note that the center of this cake will rise, creating a cute little hill at the center of a round pan.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:</span> 

  * 2 cups sourdough starter
  * 1 cup frozen blueberries
  * 1/2 cup + 1 tbsp sugar
  * 1/2 tsp salt
  * 1 cup flour
  * 1 tsp cinnamon
  * 1/3 cup butter, melted
  * 1 egg, beaten
  * 1 tsp. baking soda

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Preheat oven to 350ยบ F.
  2. Combine frozen blueberries and 1 tbsp sugar in a bowl. Microwave for 30 seconds. If still frozen, stir and microwave for another 15 seconds or so.
  3. Combine the sourdough starter, blueberries, egg and butter in a bowl; set aside.
  4. Combine all remaining ingredients in a second bowl. Combine with the wet ingredients and mix thoroughly.
  5. Pour into an 8&#8243; round non-stick cake pan.
  6. Bake for 40 minutes or until center of the cake is set.
  7. Allow to cool for 30 minutes before serving.
