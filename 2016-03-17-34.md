_The chowder has 188 calories per cup, with 9g fat (4g saturated), 16g carbs, and 12g protein._

**INGREDIENTS:**

  * 6 roasted beets
  * 1 1/2 tsp asafetida
  * 3 cups vegetable broth
  * 2 cups lactaid 2% milk
  * 2 cups nonfat cottage cheese
  * 1 tsp dry dill (better yet &#8212; a handful of chopped fresh)
  * 2 tbsp butter
  * 2 tbsp olive oil
  * 2 large onions
  * 2 tbsp flour
  * Low sodium no-chicken bouillon cube
  * Salt

**DIRECTIONS:**

  1. Heat the butter and olive oil to medium high. Add the asafetida and stir with a spatula until combined. Add the onions; sprinkle with salt. Sautee until starting to caramelize.
  2. Combine 1/2 cup broth with flour and stir until no lumps exist. Turn onions to high heat. Pout this mixture into the onions and scrape constantly until a roux is achieved. Add the remaining broth, scrape to deglaze, and allow to simmer for several minutes.
  3. Combine beets, cottage cheese, milk and dill in a blender. Blend until smooth. Pour into a separate vessel.
  4. Pour broth mixture into blender and blend until smooth. Combine with beet mixture.
