I was messing around here, so I didn&#8217;t write down any ratios. I tried including onion powder and garlic powder&#8211;I think this was not a good move. In the recipe, I&#8217;ve excluded them.

  * 1 lb firm tofu
  * ~1 tsp mayonnaise
  * ~2 tbsp lowfat sour cream
  * ~2 tsp dijon mustard
  * ~1 tbsp fresh dill relish, drained
  * ~1 tsp lemon juice
  * A bit of salt

Cut tofu lengthwise into two 1&#8243; thick slabs. Place a couple of paper towels on each side of them and sandwich between two plates, with a can of beans or a book on top to press. Let sit for a couple of hours.

Afterward, mush up the tofu a bit with your hands into a bowl. (Don&#8217;t go nuts with this). Gently mix all ingredients together.
