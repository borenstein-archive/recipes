_Based on this recipe:_ [_http://www.livestrong.com/blog/ten-minute-bake-chocolate-peanut-butter-shakeology-cookies/_](http://www.livestrong.com/blog/ten-minute-bake-chocolate-peanut-butter-shakeology-cookies/)

_Tastes a lot like halva, and has a great (though calorie-dense) nutritional profile. Very good for before or after weight training. Itâ€™s not clear that the oats are really necessary. If they were omitted, one could get an extremely halva-like block. Consider trying again with tahini, and no oats._

  * 1 cup (265g) Jif Natural peanut butter
  * 150g 365 chocolate whey protein
  * 1 cup rolled oats
  * ~1/2 tbsp vanilla
  * ~1 tsp pistachio extract

Combine all ingredients in a large bowl until it becomes an extremely dry paste. Squeeze into 21 balls, compressing each one into a thick disc. Arrange on a small pan lined with parchment paper. Flash freeze.
