**INGREDIENTS:**

  * 1/2 cup prepared pumpkin
  * 1/2 cup nonfat cottage cheese
  * 1/2 cup full fat yogurt
  * 3/4 cup quick oats
  * 2 capfuls of vanilla
  * 3 large dates (50g without pits)
  * Pinch of salt
  * 1 tsp baking powder
  * Nutmeg and cinnamon
  * 2/3 cup egg whites

**DIRECTIONS:Â **

  1. Blend thoroughly.
  2. Preheat big super nonstick skillet to medium (on the power burner).
  3. Coat with just enough butter to prevent sticking (or they will stick, even on the NS pan). With butter, they won&#8217;t form bubbles &#8212; flip when you think they&#8217;re ready. (Takes some practice.)
  4. Keep warm by trapping between plates; serve immediately.

HK note: Less dense than the banana oat-jack recipe so probably just use this and swap out with banana
