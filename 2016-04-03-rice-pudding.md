_Unfortunately, I didn’t measure anything, so everything here is ballpark._

  * 1 ½ cups milk + ¼ cup milk
  * 1 egg
  * 1/3 cup egg white
  * 2 tsp vanilla
  * 2 tbsp sugar
  * 1/8 tsp salt
  * 1 cup leftover rice

Simmer rice, salt and sugar in 1 ½ cups milk on low for 15 minutes. Combine everything else and beat thoroughly. Pour into milk mixture and let cook another 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
