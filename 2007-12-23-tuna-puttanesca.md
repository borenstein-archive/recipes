Easy, fast, cheap. Vaguely charming. Far be it from me, of course, to make a joke about puttanesca sauce being aptly named. (I&#8217;m too classy for that.) But once you realize how easy this is, you&#8217;ll feel bad about having paid $18 for it at some fancy place in the North End.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 1 can (3 oz.) tomato paste
  * 2 oz. anchovy paste (or 1 tin flat anchovy fillets)
  * 2 oz. capers
  * 6 oz. kalamata olives (without pits if possible)
  * 3 cans chunk white tuna
  * 1 large can crushed tomatoes
  * 2 tbsp. crushed garlic
  * Red pepper flakes
  * 3 tbsp. olive oil
  * 1 lb. linguini, cooked <span style="font-style: italic;">al dente</span>

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Heat the olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat.
  2. Add the anchovy paste or anchovy fillets. If fillets are used, crush them with the back of a wooden spoon as they sauté.
  3. Add in the garlic. Let the garlic and anchovies sauté for just a minute (they cook fast).
  4. Add in the tomato paste, blending with a spatula. Allow to cook for a minute.
  5. Mix in tunafish and red pepper; let cook another minute or two.
  6. Add everything else; reduce heat to medium-low and let simmer for about 10 minutes.

Serve over pasta with grated parmesan.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">PAIRINGS: </span>Use a spicy wine with high tannins. A sufficiently <span style="font-style: italic;">ripe </span>Cabernet Sauvignon is ideal. (Caution: unripe Cabernet Sauvignon tastes like the runoff from a Tabasco Sauce factory.)
