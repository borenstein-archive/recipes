I discovered LA Burdick in my second year of college, and found myself happily addicted to their rich, lathery hot and iced chocolates. I was less addicted to the several dollars that each cup costs. Fortunately, they do not keep their recipe a secret. I have halved [this recipe](http://www.theheartofnewengland.com/food-Hot-Cocoa-Burdicks-Famous-Recipe.html), which is corroborated by several other websites, for the basic hot chocolate.

This is not to say that it&#8217;s not still worth buying it from Burdick: they use shaved chocolate, a painstaking process that produces a more decadent result; and they have proper equipment for steaming and scalding milk to the perfect temperatures. If you&#8217;ve never been, you&#8217;d better try it.

I know better than to tamper with perfection: the hot chocolate keeps the original Burdick proportions. But for cafe mocha, below, I have tweaked things a bit to accommodate the coffee.

  * Pinch of white pepper (optional)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span>
