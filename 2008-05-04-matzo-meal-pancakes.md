I know passover has been over for more than a week. But I&#8217;ve still got a house full of matzo. These pancakes, whose recipe comes from <span style="font-style: italic;">The Complete Passover Cookbook</span> by Frances AvRutick, are my brother&#8217;s favorite. I have adjusted the scale to serve one, since it&#8217;s easy enough to make for an anytime breakfast. I&#8217;ve also added more sugar.

They are extremely simple since they have to be, and they are extremely dense because matzo meal neither blends nor rises. (I have experimented with making bacalao fritters using matzo meal, but the results have not yet been good enough to post here.)

Matzo meal, for those who are not &#8216;in the know&#8217;, is wheat flour that has been mixed with water and then roasted, resulting in a meal that does not dissolve or rise, like a nut flour. As such, sweets made with it have the cooking properties of tortes even though the flour is made of wheat.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:</span> 

  * 1 egg
  * 1/3 cup milk
  * 1/3 cup matzo meal
  * 1/2 tsp sugar
  * Pinch of salt

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Beat the eggs and milk in a bowl until frothy.
  2. Add all remaining ingredients.
  3. Heat a nonstick frying pan to medium-low. Apply butter or non-stick spray, then drop the batter in by the tablespoon.
  4. Turn every 45 seconds until done. You may need to press down on the mixture to flatten in out; this is easier after the batter has been turned once.

Serve immediately.
