This excellent curry is a fine alternative to a traditional split pea soup (such as [the first post on this blog](http://tofuvavohu.blogspot.com/2007/11/split-yellow-pea-soup-with-okra.html)). This one is based on the recipe entitled &#8220;Lemon-Split Pea Soup&#8221; from <span style="font-style: italic;">The Art of Seasonal Cooking</span> by Perla Meyers (New York: Simon & Schuster, 1991), which, despite its name, contained lemon only in the garnish. No matter. It is a fine recipe, and I made only a few small changes to suit my taste.

  I would certainly also try this with lentils. I also plan on adding okra and/or potatoes in a future iteration. Stay tuned.

    Meyers called for heavy cream, which struck me as profoundly gratuitous. I added light cream instead, and still felt that it was unnecessary if the soup was made with a good stock. I suppose the light cream could do something for the soup if using a commercial broth; for homemade broth, don&#8217;t bother (or use less).

    Since the soup is pureed at the end, it is acceptable to prep the carrots in a food processor.

    <span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:</span>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>
        2 tbsp. unsalted butter
      </li>
      <li>
        1 tbsp olive oil
      </li>
      <li>
        2 large onions, peeled and finely <a href="http://tofuvavohu.blogspot.com/2008/10/how-to-dice-onion.html">diced</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        3 large carrots, peeled and finely diced
      </li>
      <li>
        2 tsp. ground cumin
      </li>
      <li>
        1 1/2 cups split green peas, rinsed
      </li>
      <li>
        6 cups chicken stock
      </li>
      <li>
        6 whole black peppercorns
      </li>
      <li>
        1/2 cup light cream (optional, see above)
      </li>
      <li>
        2 tsp. minced jalapeño peppers (optional)
      </li>
      <li>
        Salt to taste
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <div>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:</span>
    </div>
    
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li>
          In a heavy soup pot, heat the butter and oil over medium-low heat. Once butter is melted, add onions and peppers. Sauté until onions are soft, stirring frequently, about 7-10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the carrots and continue to sauté for 5-6 more minutes or until carrots begin to soften.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the cumin and stir well to combine. Add the peas and stir to combine. Allow to cook with the onion mixture for a minute or two.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer, cover, and allow to cook for 45 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you have an immersion blender, use it to puree the soup to the desired consistency. Otherwise, puree in a conventional blender or food processor in small batches, then return to the pot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the cream (if using) and stir to combine. 
        </li>
        <li>
          Salt to taste.
        </li>
      </ol>

        Serve with bread. Makes an excellent leftover.
