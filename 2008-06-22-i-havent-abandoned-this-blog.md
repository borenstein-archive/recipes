A friend of mine mentioned the other day that I haven&#8217;t posted to the blog in more than a month. That&#8217;s true, but it doesn&#8217;t mean I haven&#8217;t been cooking: I&#8217;ve been making the recipes I already have here! Also, as the weather gets warmer, I&#8217;m not cooking as much; and when I do, it&#8217;s things that have short prep times and even shorter time on the heat.

I will post a recipe for the perfect hummus shortly. It&#8217;s such a simple thing, and yet only recently did I feel I had all the details to the point where the result was exactly as I wanted it.

The next time a holiday rolls around, expect another torrent of recipes&#8230;
