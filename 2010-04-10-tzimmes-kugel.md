Originally called &#8220;Mrs. Feinberg&#8217;s Vegetable Kugel,&#8221; from a cookbook by Joan Nathan, this recipe has been an absolute fixture at family events for decades.

I have substituted safflower oil for margarine and reduced the quantity of both oil and sugar by 50%. Butter or margarine could also be used; in these cases, use 1/3 cup.

I am curious as to how this would work with crushed crackers instead of matzo meal. I&#8217;ll bet water crackers would be quite similar, and graham crackers might be excellent.

We usually triple the recipe and cook it in a bundt pan.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS</span>: 

  * 1 cup grated raw apple
  * 1 cup grated raw sweet potato
  * 1 cup grated raw carrots
  * 1 cup matzo meal
  * 1/4 cup safflower oil (or 1/3 cup margarine or butter)
  * 1/4 cup sugar
  * 1/2 tsp salt
  * 1 tsp baking powder
  * 1 tsp cinnamon
  * 3/4 tsp nutmeg

 <span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:</span> 

  1. Preheat oven to 325.
  2. In a large bowl, combine apples, sweet potatoes and carrots.
  3. In another bowl, combine all dry ingredients.
  4. Add oil to vegetable mixture and combine well. Add in dry ingredients and combine well.
  5. Grease a loaf pan or muffin tins and add the mixture to the pan. (You can also triple the recipe and use a bundt pan; see above.)
  6. Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes (muffins), 45 minutes (loaf) or 1 hour (bundt pan).
  7. Increase heat to 350, remove foil, and bake for an additional 15 minutes.
  8. Allow to cool slightly before slicing.
