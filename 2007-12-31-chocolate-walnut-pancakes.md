When Aunt Ramona made me pancakes&#8211;the way they make &#8217;em in South Carolina, <span style="font-style: italic;">darlin!</span>&#8211;I came to understand that the humble pancake need not be so shy: it can puff itself a mile into the air and take its place with any biscuit. In fact, that&#8217;s exactly what a southern pancake should be: a giant, soft, mildly sweet, griddle-fried biscuit.

Alas, the art of making this happen was lost on me. Finally, today, [this recipe](http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Good-Old-Fashioned-Pancakes/Detail.aspx) showed me that the trick is to use a startling amount of baking powder. I think they might be going a bit overboard with 3 1/2 tsp., but maybe I&#8217;m wrong&#8211;who knows?

I have decided that I like the earthy flavor of whole wheat flour in pancakes, especially when they&#8217;re filled with nuts, as I have done below.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">UPDATE 4/18/2008: </span>In an effort to use up all my chametz prior to passover, I made a lot of pancakes. I observed the following things: 

  * No, it isn&#8217;t crazy to use 3 1/2 tsp. baking powder. Your pancakes are just going to be huge.
  * Pancake batter is best if used immediately, but keeps 2-3 days after preparation as long as you have added no significant acid sources, such as fresh berries. After adding berries, use batter immediately.
  * Leftover batter does not rise as much.
  * It takes awhile for the pan to reach full heat. When in doubt, start with one small pancake.
  * The pancakes are ready to flip when the batter is bubbling on the top.
  * I highly recommend adding vanilla to every batch.
  * 

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour
  * 2 tsp. baking powder
  * 1 tsp. salt
  * 2 tbsp. sugar
  * 1 1/4 cup milk
  * 1 medium egg, beaten
  * 3 tbsp. butter, melted
  * 1/3 cup walnuts, chopped
  * 1/3 cup bittersweet chocolate (60% cocao recommended)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<br /></span> 

  1. Combine the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar in a mixing bowl.
  2. Add the milk, egg and butter and mix thoroughly until smooth.
  3. Add the walnuts and chocolate and mix until even.
  4. Heat a small, non-stick skillet (not much bigger than the pancakes you want) to medium-high heat. Put a plate next to the stove.
  5. Using a tablespoon, put 2-3 gobs of batter into the skillet.
  6. Cook for about 45 seconds per side, then remove to the plate. <span style="font-weight: bold;">Try making a couple small pancakes first to get the heat and the duration right.</span>

Serve immediately.
