I&#8217;ve been trying to make my own variant of this since December, when a Persian friend opened my eyes to it. I finally nailed it. The trick was the special preparation of garlic. I have no idea if this is authentic (beyond the substitution of lowfat sour cream for kashk), but honestly it&#8217;s too tasty to care.

Proportions&#8211;sorry, I didn&#8217;t measure anything! But with this sort of thing, it&#8217;s really a matter of taste.

  * 1 large purple eggplant, sliced into 3/4&#8243; slices. Don&#8217;t peel it!
  * 1 head of garlic, **peeled** **but not chopped or cut at all! Just remove the skins!**
  * 2 small onions, chopped
  * Handful of chopped flat-leaf parsley
  * A few leaves of fresh basil
  * Between 1/4 cup and 1/3 cup lowfat sour cream
  * About 1/4 cup olive oil
  * Salt
  * Red pepper flakes
  * Juice of 1/4 of a lime

  Directions&#8211;

<div>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat the oven to 450.
    </li>
    <li>
      Roast the eggplant for 40 minutes, flipping over halfway through. Allow to cool until near room temperature (20 minutes or so).
    </li>
    <li>
      Meanwhile, heat the olive oil in a heavy frying pan over a medium-high heat.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once a single piece of onion will sizzle in the olive oil, add all the garlic and onion. (You did leave your peeled garlic intact, right?) Saute until golden.
    </li>
    <li>
      Put everything in a food processor. Don&#8217;t make it too smooth; you want some texture.
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <div>
    Garnish with a bit more parsley and olive oil. Delicious with sliced cucumbers!
