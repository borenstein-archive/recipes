This stuff is a workout to make; you really feel it in your arms. Which is great, since a workout is exactly what you&#8217;ll need after eating a few of these diabolical candies. Based on [this recipe](http://www.recipezaar.com/Costa-Rican-Coconut-Fudge-Cajeta-De-Coco-125603).

I was actually trying to figure out how to make these butter macaroons that I had in Costa Rica, and basically wound up with dulce de leche instead. I&#8217;m not complaining.

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS:<br /></span> 

  * 2 cans (14 oz each) of sweetened condensed milk
  * 4 oz. unsweetened shredded coconut (1-2 cups depending on shred size)
  * 1 cup butter
  * 4 graham crackers
  * 1 tsp vanilla
  * 1/4 tsp salt
  * (optional) 1 cup peanuts or other nuts, crushed

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:</span> 

  1. Grind the graham crackers into crumbs using a food processor.
  2. Combine all ingredients in a nonstick saucepan.
  3. Heat over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture begins to bubble.
  4. Beat the mixture constantly over medium heat until it begins to get very thick and caramel-colored.
  5. Let the mixture cool for several minutes. As soon as it is cool enough to handle, roll into 1&#8243; balls.
  6. (optional) Roll the balls in the crushed peanuts before placing on a cookie sheet to cool.

The candies keep well in an airtight container; separate layers with wax paper to prevent sticking. Reheat in microwave for 15 seconds before serving.
