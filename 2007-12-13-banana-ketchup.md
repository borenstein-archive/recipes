Real ketchup has very little in common with the highly-processed red stuff you get in the plastic bottle. It also doesn&#8217;t have to contain any tomatoes at all, although this recipe happens to have a little. Use this banana ketchup anywhere you would have used ordinary ketchup&#8211;on meat, eggs, fries, whatever. The banana flavor provides a smooth, gentle balance to the zesty sweetness of the vinegar and spices.

One note: this recipe produces a <span style="font-weight: bold;">lot</span> of ketchup. If you double it, you had better be planning on giving some away. (Although you should <span style="font-weight: bold;">always</span> give away jars of homemade sauces, preserves and jams: people will think of you whenever they eat it!)

My recipe is based on [this one](http://homecooking.about.com/od/condimentrecipes/r/blcon77.htm), with some significant modifications. In particular, I thought theirs was far too acerbic, not thick enough, and I strongly disagree that the ketchup should be strained: the good stuff is what was left in the strainer!

<span style="font-weight: bold;">INGREDIENTS</span>: 

  * 4 large, ripe bananas
  * 1/2 cup golden raisins
  * 1 medium onion
  * 1 tbsp chopped garlic
  * 3 oz. tomato paste
  * 1/2 cup cider vinegar
  * 1/3 cup lemon juice
  * 1/2 cup brown sugar
  * 1/4 cup dark molasses
  * 1 1/2 tsp. (=1/2 tbsp.) salt
  * 1 tsp. allspice
  * 1 tsp. cinnamon
  * 1/2 tsp. nutmeg
  * 1/4 tsp. cloves
  * Hot pepper to taste

<span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTIONS:<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span></span> 

  1. Chop onions in a food processor with the metal blade.
  2. To the onions, add bananas, raisins, garlic, tomato paste and vinegar to the chopped onions. Puree until smooth.
  3. Transfer the puree to a <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">nonstick</span> saucepan. (Nonstick or you&#8217;ll be sorry!)
  4. Add 1 1/2 cups water, the lemon juice, brown sugar, salt and hot pepper; stir thoroughly.
  5. Bring to a <span style="font-weight: bold;">gentle</span> simmer and allow to simmer, uncovered, for 60 minutes, occasionally stirring and removing the scum from the top.
  6. Add the molasses and the spices; let cook for another 30 minutes or until desired consistency is reached.
  7. Let stand for 10 minutes.
  8. Pour into glass jars, and/or set some aside to make barbecue sauce.

Refrigerate. Keeps for 1 month.
